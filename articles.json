Otherwise, it’s possible that you may be hitting a temporary server error due to excessive load on the Bluesky network and you’ll have to try connecting your Bluesky account again later.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JHKE0REB3N61580PK2TPTFR6\">Using a Custom Domain with Bluesky</h1>\n<p>In order to link a Bluesky account with a custom-domain handle, Discord will need to look up your account’s DID. This happens when you initially connect the Bluesky account on Discord and then on an ongoing basis to keep your account connected to Discord. </p>\n<p>Verification happens in the same way described in the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/specs/handle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AT Protocol documentation</a> and the <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bluesky blog</a>.</p>\n<p>When verifying a domain using the /.well-known/atproto-did method, Discord will use a user-agent string in the form of <code>Discord/1.0 (Discord API; +https://discordapp.com</code>. </p>\n<p>Please ensure that your web server does not block requests with this user-agent, or severely rate-limit requests to this endpoint.</p>\n<p>You can simulate the request Discord will make to verify your handle using a curl command in this form: <code>curl -H 'User-Agent: Discord/1.0 (Discord API; +https://discordapp.com)' https://{your-handle-here}/.well-known/atproto-did</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JHKE0REBV2TX0B2MVYBSHM1K\">Custom PDS Providers</h2>\n<p>Discord supports linking AT Protocol accounts hosted by third-party PDS providers in the same way as accounts hosted by Bluesky. If hosting your own PDS, please ensure that your web server allows Discord’s user-agent on the authentication and PDS data endpoints, in addition to the <code>/.well-known/atproto-did</code> endpoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JHKE0REB44CG7RMBX0M8W4HZ\">did:web: accounts</h2>\n<p>Discord also supports linking AT Protocol accounts that use <code>did:web: identifiers</code>. The requirements for the <code>/.well-known/atproto-did endpoint also apply to the /.well-known/did.json</code> endpoint.</p>\n<div class=\"form-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>If you run into any issues with linking your Bluesky account to your Discord account, please reach out to our support team through here: <a href=\"http://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://dis.gd/contact</a>\n</div>"

These sellers often advertise through unsolicited messages, social media, or unofficial websites. To identify them, look for offers that require external payments, unusual URLs, or methods that don’t involve the Discord app or official Amazon store. Remember: if it’s not from a Discord source described in this article, it’s not official.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What does a phishing attempt look like?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Phishing attempts often appear as fake messages or links designed to trick you into providing sensitive information, like your login credentials or payment details. Common signs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Messages claiming you’ve won or received free products or rewards, like Nitro, but requiring you to click a suspicious link.</li>\n<li>Threats to your account status unless you take immediate action.</li>\n<li>Requests for your password, account login, or personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Discord will never ask for your login details or for your payment information through unsolicited messages. Always verify links and contact <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord support</a> directly if you’re unsure.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are safe messaging practices to avoid unsolicited scams?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> To protect yourself from unsolicited messages and scams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid engaging with messages from unknown users, especially those offering deals or rewards.</li>\n<li>Enable <strong>Safe Direct Messaging</strong> under <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> to automatically scan DMs from non-friends for harmful content.</li>\n<li>Report suspicious messages or users by following the steps outlined <a href=\"https://dis.gd/howtoreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Never click on links from untrusted sources. Even if they appear to come from someone you know, accounts can be compromised.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #434343;\">If you ever need to verify if a source is a legitimate Discord source or not, you can reach out to the </span><a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord support team</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\">.</span></p>"

You can learn how to manage your billing information <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017693772-Payments-and-Billing-FAQ\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">here</span></a>.</p>\n<p>2. Ensure your card details are entered correctly.</p>\n<p>3. Ensure the card hasn’t expired.</p>\n<p>4. Depending on the card, ensure there are sufficient funds in the account or that the credit limit hasn’t been exceeded.</p>\n<p>5. It’s possible a pre-set spending limit on the card was reached. Double-check if a spending limit has been set.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> If issues persist after following the steps above, Discord's Support team cannot provide further assistance.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JFBDZDD0SGKQT5Q6X8H47X2K\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

(“<strong>Media Company</strong>”) and the advertiser designated on an IO (“<strong>Advertiser</strong>”), or, if applicable, Advertiser’s agency designated on an IO (“<strong>Agency</strong>”).  The terms of this Discord Addendum will control over and fully supersede any similar, conflicting, inconsistent or overlapping terms in the IAB Terms or other parts of an IO; however, if an IO expressly states that certain terms set forth in the IO are intended to supersede the terms of this Discord Addendum, then, in the event of conflict, those terms of the applicable IO will control only for that IO and only to the extent of such conflict. Any purchase order terms, “clickthrough” or other online agreements, or other similar documents made available to Media Company by Advertiser or Agency are hereby rejected by Media Company and will not apply to any Quest. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings given to such terms in the IAB Terms. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Where Advertiser is purchasing directly from Media Company, (i) <span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Section 2 and </span>any references to Agency herein will be deemed deleted and will not apply; and (ii) all references in the IAB Terms to Agency, will be deemed to be references to Advertiser.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Quest Terms.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">a. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quests</span>. Media Company will implement a promotional campaign on its platform (the “<strong>Discord Platform</strong>”) for Advertiser’s applicable property designated on an IO (the “<strong>Advertiser Property</strong>”) where eligible users of the Discord Platform will be able to complete certain agreed-upon tasks relating to the Advertiser Property and earn certain agreed-upon rewards (“<strong>Rewards</strong>”), as further detailed in an applicable IO (each such campaign, a “<strong>Quest</strong>”).  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">b. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quest T&amp;Cs</span>. Media Company will, in consultation with Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, establish the specific terms and requirements for users governing each Quest (“<strong>Quest T&amp;Cs</strong>”), and will publish the Quest T&amp;Cs to users in connection with such Quest. The Quest T&amp;Cs will address, at a minimum (i) user eligibility requirements and any criteria and tasks that must be satisfied by a user in order to receive a Reward; (ii) the nature of the applicable Reward, including whether the Reward will be supplied by Media Company (each, a “<strong>Media Company Reward</strong>”) or Advertiser (each, an “<strong>Advertiser Reward</strong>”); and (iv) any other terms, conditions and limitations pertaining to the redemption and use of the Reward.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">c. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Advertiser Rewards</span>. Unless otherwise indicated on an IO, the Reward will be an Advertiser Reward approved by Media Company and either the Advertiser or Agency, as applicable. For any Quest with an Advertiser Reward: (i) reasonably in advance of the applicable flight dates for a Quest, the parties will agree in writing (email to suffice) on and implement the fulfillment and redemption mechanics for the Advertiser Reward, which may consist of the delivery to Media Company of a sufficient number of redemption codes for users to redeem for Advertiser Rewards; (ii) Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will ensure that the Advertiser Reward and the redemption process is consistent with the Quest T&amp;Cs; and (iii) in the event of any fulfillment or redemption issues (including, without limitation, insufficient or defective redemption codes) in connection with a Quest, Media Company may suspend such Quest until such issues are resolved.  For clarity, Advertiser is solely responsible for the Advertiser Rewards and any associated fraud, losses, or other issues in connection with such Advertiser Rewards. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">d. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Media Company Rewards</span>.  For any Quest where the applicable IO indicates there will be a Media Company Reward, Media Company will (i) ensure that such Media Company Reward and redemption process is consistent with the Quest T&amp;Cs; and (ii) will have responsibility (unless otherwise agreed in the IO) and control over the design and creation of such Media Company Reward. Media Company will obtain Advertiser’s or Agency’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) for any Media Company Reward that contains or is derived from Advertising Materials. Media Company Rewards may not be available to users in certain regions where not supported by the Discord Platform. Advertiser and Agency may not terminate for convenience any Quest with (i) a Media Company Reward that contains or is derived from Advertising Materials or (ii) any other custom Media Company Reward created specifically for the Quest. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">e. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Advertiser Marks License</span>. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">i. Advertiser and Agency hereby grant Media Company a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use and display Advertiser’s name, designated trademarks and associated logos, and any names, trademarks or logos associated with the Advertiser Property (the “<strong>Advertiser Marks</strong>”) in connection with the implementation of a Quest, the performance of Media Company’s obligations under the Campaign Terms and any IO, or as otherwise approved in writing by Advertiser or Agency. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">ii. All goodwill and improved reputation generated by Media Company’s use of the Advertiser Marks inures to the exclusive benefit of Advertiser. Media Company will use the Advertiser Marks in a manner consistent with any branding guidelines provided by Advertiser to Media Company in writing.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">f. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Advertising Materials</span>.  Advertiser and Agency hereby grant Media Company a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, adapt, translate, modify, copy, publicly perform, transmit and distribute the Advertising Materials in connection with the implementation or promotion of a Quest, the performance of Media Company’s obligations under the Campaign Terms or as otherwise approved by Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, including, without limitation, in connection with the development, distribution and making available of applicable Media Company Rewards containing or derived from such Advertising Materials. The licenses set forth herein are sublicensable by Media Company to its affiliates, agents, and subcontractors in connection with Media Company performance hereunder (and, with respect to Media Company Rewards containing or derived from Advertising Materials, to end users who claim any such Media Company Rewards in connection with a Quest). Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will, at its own cost and expense, obtain all necessary licenses, consents, approvals and permissions from any third party required for Media Company to exercise its rights under the foregoing license. For purposes of the Campaign Terms, “<strong>Advertising Materials</strong>” means any content, materials, copy, branding, images, names, audio, music, video, artwork, designs, descriptions, specifications, and other elements made available by Advertiser or Agency to Media Company for use in connection with a Quest, including, without limitation, any elements, materials, assets or intellectual property from the Advertiser Property. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">g. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Cooperation</span>.  Media Company’s ability to implement the Quest and its obligations under the Campaign Terms and any IO (including, without limitation, the ability to meet the applicable timeframes and schedules for a Quest as specified in an IO) will be contingent upon the timely provision of cooperation from Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, in connection with the Quest, which cooperation includes, without limitation, providing any redemption codes, Advertising Materials and/or Advertiser Rewards as required by Media Company with sufficient lead time for the applicable Quest, compliance with applicable Policies or other campaign and asset specifications, and timely feedback, reviews and approvals for any items and matters requiring approval or input in connection with a Quest. Advertiser and Agency will adhere to any Policies and other agreed upon timeframes, campaign specifications, and development schedules in connection with the foregoing. Media Company will not be liable or responsible for any delays or issues caused by Advertiser’s or Agency’s failure or delay in providing such cooperation.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">h. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quest Prompts</span>.  Media Company will be responsible for developing, producing, and displaying prompts or notifications promoting the availability of a Quest (“<strong>Quest Prompts</strong>”) to certain users on applicable surfaces within the Discord Platform. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Media Company will have ultimate authority and control over the content, placement, frequency, delivery, timing and accompanying disclosures in connection with all Quest Prompts on the Discord Platform. Media Company reserves the right to suspend or cancel the targeting, personalization, and/or delivery of Quest Prompts in connection with any Quest.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">i. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Reporting</span>.  For each Quest, Media Company will provide summary reports to Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, regarding certain estimated performance metrics, insights and KPIs within a reasonable timeframe after the midpoint and end date of such Quest. The information in such reports may be used by Advertiser solely for its own internal business purposes but will otherwise be considered Media Company’s Confidential Information. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">j. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Estimates</span>.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any impression or reach numbers, impression-related commitments, targeting parameters, geographies or estimates provided on an IO and any information provided in connection with any report delivered by Media Company with respect to any Quest are provided by Media Company solely on an “AS IS” basis as estimates for informational purposes based on the data reasonably available to Media Company and are not guaranteed or considered binding by the parties in connection with any Quest. Media Company will not be liable (or required to offer any makegood) for any errors, shortfalls, inaccuracies or omissions in connection with any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Agency Authority.</strong>  Agency represents, warrants and covenants that it has obtained and will maintain all consents, approvals and authorizations from Advertiser necessary for Agency to (i) bind Advertiser to the Campaign Terms and any IO, act on behalf of Advertiser and otherwise comply with its obligations in connection with the Campaign Terms and any IO, including, without limitation, with respect to (a) the execution of any IOs on Advertiser’s behalf, (b) the ability to pay Media Company for any Quest; (c) the ability to share Advertiser’s Confidential Information with Media Company; and (c) the management and provision of any and all approvals, feedback and reviews in connection with the Campaign Terms and any IO (e.g., the review and approval of Rewards and other Quest elements, press releases, promotional materials, or creative assets); and (ii) grant the licenses set forth in the Campaign Terms and any IO, including, without limitation, any such licenses to Advertiser Marks and Advertising Materials set forth herein. Media Company will be entitled to rely on any documents executed, instructions provided or approvals granted by Agency on an Advertiser’s behalf in connection with the Campaign Terms and any IO. Agency will indemnify and hold Media Company harmless from and against any losses or unpaid obligations under any IOs arising from Agency’s violation of this Section. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Taxes</strong>. Unless otherwise stated in an IO, Media Company’s fees do not include any direct or indirect local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including value-added, use, sales or withholding taxes collected by any jurisdiction. Each party is responsible for all of its own business taxes (including, but not limited to, net income, gross receipts, franchise, or other similar business taxes) arising as a result of or in connection with any IO. Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, is responsible for self-assessing any transaction taxes (e.g. sales tax, VAT, GST or similar taxes) due with respect to any IO. Media Company will collect, and Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will pay any applicable transaction taxes if Media Company determines that it has a duty to collect such taxes. Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, is responsible for any transaction taxes on user rewards redeemed outside of the Discord Platform. For transaction tax purposes, Quests will be treated as services related to promotional advertising campaigns. To the extent withholding tax is required by applicable law, Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will be responsible for collecting and remitting such taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Additionally, Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will provide Media Company an original receipt or documentation from the tax authority for the withholding tax payments.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Amendments to IAB Terms. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">a. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">General Acknowledgements</span>.  The parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) Quests are treated as flat-fee based Deliverables delivered on the Discord Platform for purposes of the IAB Terms; (ii) the terms of the IAB Terms relating to inventory availability, delivery schedule, ad placement and positioning, use of collected data, and reporting will be superseded and governed by the applicable terms of Section 1 of this Discord Addendum and any IO; and (iii) Quests do not use or involve any Third Party Ad Server and any associated terms in the IAB Terms do not apply.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">b. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Specific Amendments</span>. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">i. Section X(b) of the IAB Terms is hereby amended to add the following new subclauses (iv) and (v):</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify wysiwyg-indent4\"><em>“(iv) allegations that the Advertising Materials or Advertiser Marks infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights of a third party; or (v) Advertiser Rewards, including, without limitation, any claims from users that Advertiser Rewards were misleading or inaccurate or that they were not properly fulfilled.</em>”</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">ii. Section XI of the IAB Terms is hereby amended and restated as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify wysiwyg-indent4\">“<em>Excluding Agency’s, Advertiser’s, and Media Company’s respective indemnification obligations under the Campaign Terms, damages that result from a breach of Section XII, or intentional misconduct by Agency, Advertiser, or Media Company, in no event will any party be liable (i) for any consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or exemplary damages whatsoever or any damages for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of information, and the like, incurred by another party arising out of an IO, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages; or (ii) in the aggregate in connection with these Campaign Terms or the IO in excess of the amount paid or payable by Agency or Advertiser to Media Company hereunder.</em>”</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">iii. For purposes of Section XIV(d) of the IAB Terms, the choice of law governing any IO will be the State of New York without reference to its choice of law rules, and all claims, legal proceedings or litigations arising in connection with the Campaign Terms will be brought solely in state and federal courts located in New York City.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">iv. Section XIV.e of the IAB Terms is hereby amended and restated as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">“<em>All notices of termination or breach must be in English, in writing and addressed to the other party’s legal department (with a copy to any contact listed on an IO). The email address for notices being sent to the Media Company legal department is legal.notices@discordapp.com. All other notices must be in English, in writing (including email) and addressed to the other party’s applicable notice information designated on an IO. Notice will be treated as given on receipt, as verified by written or automated receipt or by electronic log (as applicable).</em>”</p>"

The HD Splash Potion grants HD streaming quality in a designated channel for a set period of time—for you, your friends, and other server members who have access to that voice channel. No Nitro or server boosts required!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How long does the HD Splash Potion last?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Once used, the HD Splash Potion will grant 12 hours of HD streaming quality in the channel where it was activated. Anyone who joins the designated channel will enjoy HD streaming until the potion’s effect expires.</p>\n<p>You can still control your streaming quality at any time. For instance, if you notice your device’s performance struggling, you can adjust the streaming quality in the Share Your Screen pop out.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does everyone in the channel need to have or use a HD Splash Potion to enjoy HD streaming quality?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope! Just one person needs to use their potion in a designated channel to grant everyone in that channel the ability to benefit from HD streaming quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need to be friends with the potion user to receive HD streaming from the potion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Not at all! Once someone uses their HD Splash potion in a channel, anyone can enjoy HD streaming quality in that designated channel, regardless of friendship status.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens when the 12 hours are up?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Once the time is up, HD streaming quality in the designated channel will return to its standard quality for anyone without an active Nitro subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I move the HD Splash effect from my potion to a different channel after I’ve activated it in one channel?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope. The HD Splash potion will only grant its effect in the channel where it was used. Choose the voice channel carefully before activating the potion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s your refund policy for the HD Splash Potion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Potions are non-refundable—we’re unable to refund potions after purchase or use.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if a person with low bandwidth is watching my HD Splash Potion stream?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The effect of the HD Splash Potion can be impacted by the technical limitations of your or your fellow streamers' device or bandwidth. HD streaming capability may be limited if people watching your stream have low bandwidth or are tuning in from an unsupported device. To ensure that everyone in the call can benefit from the HD Splash Potion, make sure everyone in the call has a strong internet connection and is watching from a desktop device.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JA8Q445N15CEYT0QYEMR65FN\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!
