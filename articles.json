It applies to all internet traffic outside of Discord, covering browsing and any other online applications.</p><div class=\"toc-box\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\"><strong>What this article covers:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eb36db58fb70af8d01c36a4bfa4aa2844\"><a href=\"#h_01KBFMHB632K2QFEGD1SKQXCJZ\">What is the Nitro Privacy Perk?</a></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e29a0e24181c07c3a8e2710ff5a3357d1\"><a href=\"#h_01KBFMHB6E2S5NHGGCB506M5V6\">How to Access the Privacy Perk</a></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e8ee4dca3a799b45862b454886aeab3ed\">\n<a href=\"#h_01KBFMHB6S2KJHTEES372G1S6D\">How to Use the Privacy Perk</a><ul><li data-list-item-id=\"efa7b49522f4094225853073aeb86e003\"><a href=\"#h_01KBFMHB6T8HMD6B8CT0AFMG55\">Turning WARP+ On and Off</a></li></ul>\n</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e8c64c6e88a62e962500b5d2ac384247d\"><a href=\"#h_01KBFMHB70SJT5R9MTB23SATWY\">Frequently Asked Question</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class=\"exp-box\">\n<strong>Info:</strong> This is an experimental feature available to select Nitro users.

Your activity within Discord follows our standard privacy practices, which you can learn about in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this slow down my internet connection?</strong></p><p>A: WARP+ is designed for speed, but because it encrypts your traffic, you may notice slight changes in connection performance. Most users won't notice a difference during regular browsing. </p><p><strong>Q: WARP+ is affecting my gaming performance. What should I do?</strong></p><p>A: Because WARP+ encrypts all your internet traffic, it may occasionally increase latency in some online games. If you notice performance issues while gaming, try turning off WARP+ temporarily while you play, then turn it back on when you're done. Your privacy protection will resume automatically.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use WARP+ on mobile devices?</strong></p><p>A: The Nitro Privacy Perk is currently only available on Windows and Mac desktop apps. We're always exploring ways to bring more value to Nitro subscribers across all platforms.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this hide my Discord activity from Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, WARP+ enhances your privacy while browsing outside of Discord. Discord can still see your activity within the Discord platform according to your privacy settings and and our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>. WARP+ does not provide IP masking for Discord platform activity.</p><p><strong>Q: What's the difference between WARP and WARP+?</strong></p><p>A: WARP is Cloudflare's free privacy service, while WARP+ (included with Nitro) offers enhanced performance and routing. When you have an active Nitro subscription, you automatically get access to WARP+ features. If your subscription ends, you'll have access to the standard WARP features.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use this perk if I already have other privacy tools installed?</strong></p><p>A: You can have WARP+ installed alongside other privacy tools, but running multiple services simultaneously may cause connection conflicts. We recommend choosing one privacy solution at a time for the best experience.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this perk impact safety on Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, we remain deeply committed to creating positive experiences for our users and this tool is part of that commitment. Everything you could ever want to know about safety on Discord can be found <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">here</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will WARP+ allow me to use an IP address from another country? </strong></p><p>A: No. WARP+ will assign you a Cloudflare IP address corresponding to the region in which you are connecting from. </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>",

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

Your activity within Discord follows our standard privacy practices, which you can learn about in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this slow down my internet connection?</strong></p><p>A: WARP+ is designed for speed, but because it encrypts your traffic, you may notice slight changes in connection performance. Most users won't notice a difference during regular browsing. </p><p><strong>Q: WARP+ is affecting my gaming performance. What should I do?</strong></p><p>A: Because WARP+ encrypts all your internet traffic, it may occasionally increase latency in some online games. If you notice performance issues while gaming, try turning off WARP+ temporarily while you play, then turn it back on when you're done. Your privacy protection will resume automatically.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use WARP+ on mobile devices?</strong></p><p>A: The Nitro Privacy Perk is currently only available on Windows and Mac desktop apps. We're always exploring ways to bring more value to Nitro subscribers across all platforms.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this hide my Discord activity from Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, WARP+ enhances your privacy while browsing outside of Discord. Discord can still see your activity within the Discord platform according to your privacy settings and and our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>. WARP+ does not provide IP masking for Discord platform activity.</p><p><strong>Q: What's the difference between WARP and WARP+?</strong></p><p>A: WARP is Cloudflare's free privacy service, while WARP+ (included with Nitro) offers enhanced performance and routing. When you have an active Nitro subscription, you automatically get access to WARP+ features. If your subscription ends, you'll have access to the standard WARP features.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use this perk if I already have other privacy tools installed?</strong></p><p>A: You can have WARP+ installed alongside other privacy tools, but running multiple services simultaneously may cause connection conflicts. We recommend choosing one privacy solution at a time for the best experience.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this perk impact safety on Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, we remain deeply committed to creating positive experiences for our users and this tool is part of that commitment. Everything you could ever want to know about safety on Discord can be found <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">here</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will WARP+ allow me to use an IP address from another country? </strong></p><p>A: No. WARP+ will assign you a Cloudflare IP address corresponding to the region in which you are connecting from. </p>",

Without Discord's standard safety features, you should take extra precautions to protect yourself in these external spaces.</p><p><strong>Before You Join:</strong> Avoid joining servers hosted by people you don’t know and trust in real life or from well-known groups you trust. Be selective—these servers may have different safety features from those you’re used to on Discord, so your choice of which servers to join becomes your primary safety measure.</p><p><strong>Protect Your Privacy:</strong> Refrain from sharing personal information like your real name, location, age, school, or contact details on game servers. Be especially cautious of anyone who tries to move conversations to other platforms, offers unexpected gifts or special treatment, or asks you to keep interactions secret. These are red flags for potentially harmful behavior that can escalate quickly in unmoderated spaces.</p><p><strong>Use Available Safety Tools:</strong> Consider enabling any safety features the server offers like chat filters, allowlist controls, and moderation plugins. When creating your own server, use allowlist controls to limit access to known friends, enable moderation tools, and establish clear behavioral expectations from the start. Remember that these tools may differ from what you're used to with Discord's built-in protections.</p><p><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If someone makes you uncomfortable, leave immediately. Your safety is more important than game progress, maintaining friendships, or avoiding awkwardness. It's never your fault if someone acts inappropriately toward you. Report concerning behavior <em>happening in the game server</em> to the server admin if you trust them, or use the game host's reporting system (like <a href=\"https://shockbyte.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Shockbyte's support form</span></a>). If you see behavior that violates our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Terms of Service</span></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Community Guidelines</span></a> <em>happening on Discord</em>, please <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">report it directly to us</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> These servers exist outside Discord's safety ecosystem, meaning the automatic detection systems and rapid response teams you might expect aren't available. Maintain strong boundaries, be skeptical of unusual requests, and prioritize your wellbeing over gameplay.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K7Q3AJERHPMXVXGTSMN52DZK\">How to Join a Game Server</h2><p>Once created, game servers will appear in the new Game Servers tab at the top of your server.

Boosts used to level up your server <strong>do not</strong> count toward unlocking Game Servers.

Once a game server is created, the Game Servers tab will appear in your server.</p><p><strong>Q: How many Boosts does it cost to create a Game Server?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> The number of Boosts required depends on the <strong>game and plan</strong> you choose.

All Boosts allocated go directly toward that game server, there’s <strong>no extra Boost cost</strong> just to unlock the feature.</p><p><strong>Q: How many Game Servers can be created in one Discord server?</strong></p><p>A: You can have a maximum of 10 Game Servers per Discord server.</p><p><strong>Q: What does the current game server’s status mean? </strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/35684686208919\" width=\"624\" height=\"324\"></strong></p><h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" id=\"h_01K7Q3ATDXXJ8WMYKQPFQ2NW7S\">\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\">Server Status of a Game Server</span> </h4><p>A: Depending on the state of the server, you may see a variety of different Server Statuses.

You can learn more at this <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4708041338391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Help Center article.</span></a></p><p><strong>Q: What if I'm a current or previous Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or a Server Boost subscription? Can I also take part in this promotion? </strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>If you previously had a Discord Nitro subscription at any point on your accounts and have had a Nitro Classic or Nitro Basic subscription in the past 12 months, you are ineligible to redeem this promotion.</p><p>If you have had a Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting subscription active on your account and you’ve never had a Nitro subscription, you will be able to redeem this promotion and replace it with the Nitro subscription.</p><div class=\"warn-box\">HOWEVER, please note: By choosing to activate this trial, you will lose any features associated with your current subscriptions, and **you will not receive a refund for any remaining value on your current subscription**.</div><p>At the end of the promotion period, you'll be converted to a paying Nitro subscription per month unless you cancel your subscription.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K3W2ZXGR2KY6DPJQV0AV3F98\">Payment Info and Subscription Questions</h2><p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your  trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p><p>However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time before the end of the trial.</p><p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K3W2ZXGTPFWERPKYPWY0GBJQ\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro subscription so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p><p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this perk.</p><p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p><p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a \"This gift has been claimed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p><p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p><p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if you are given an invalid promo and we will not be able to provide a new promo.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error when I click on “Next”.</strong></p><p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p><ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ef94a71783540cbf4777549deceffcb2c\">You are ineligible for this promotion</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec18ff79ab554ccd8188a316f21b3f119\">The promotion is invalid</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec1767da0234072d31fa8a5e91fd37b25\">The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e42dbb8c1356674f49cb417d5eab04174\">The link is invalid</li>\n</ul><p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem. See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p><p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p><p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">this article</span></a>!</p><p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p><p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p><p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><div class=\"info-box\">Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K20JEN2SYZAXMAFSMH89160J\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!
