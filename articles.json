As this legislation comes into effect, UK users will experience new default settings designed to create a teen-appropriate experience by default, while maintaining a positive experience using the service.</p><p>While the Online Safety Act introduces new requirements specifically for UK users, these changes build on our existing safety architecture and represent our ongoing commitment to age-appropriate experiences worldwide.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this apply to all UK Discord users?</strong></p><p>A: The features and experiences described above apply to all new and existing UK accounts.</p><p><strong>Q: What age verification methods are available?</strong></p><p>A: There are two primary verification methods available:</p><ol>\n<li>Face Scan: Uses your device's camera to verify your age group</li>\n<li>ID Scan: Allows you to scan an identification document</li>\n</ol><p>You can also request a manual review with our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trust &amp; Safety team</a>.</p><div class=\"book-box\">For detailed instructions on each method, please see our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">How to Complete Age Verification on Discord</span></a> article.</div><p><strong>Q: Is my personal data stored during the verification process?</strong></p><p>A: Discord and k-ID do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies. Images of your identity documents and ID match selfies are deleted directly after your age group is confirmed, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device.</p><p><strong>Q: What if my age verification fails or shows incorrect results?</strong></p><p>A: If verification fails or shows incorrect results, you have two options:</p><ol>\n<li>Retry the verification through Discord system messages by selecting \"<strong>Retry</strong>\".</li>\n<li>Request a manual review through our support system.</li>\n</ol><div class=\"book-box\">For more information on handling verification issues, visit our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">How to Complete Age Verification on Discord</span></a> article.</div><p><strong>Q: Do I need to verify my age every time I access age-restricted content or attempt to update a default setting?</strong></p><p>A: No. Age verification is a one-time process. Once your age group is confirmed, you won't need to verify again. If you are verified into the teen age group (13-17 years old), you will not be able to adjust the settings described above until you verify as at least 18 years old. </p><p><strong>Q: What happens if I'm verified as under 18?</strong></p><p>A: If you're verified as under 18, certain default safety settings will remain in place that cannot be changed. These include sensitive content filters, message request settings and restrictions when attempting to access <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051-Age-Restricted-Channels-and-Content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">age-restricted channels</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I appeal if I believe my account was incorrectly age-restricted?</strong></p><p>A: Yes.

Think of servers as virtual meeting places that bring people together around shared interests, hobbies, or relationships. Each server is organized with different channels dedicated to specific purposes—whether that's text conversations, voice chats, or media sharing—making it easy to keep discussions organized and accessible.</p>\n<p>Discord servers are free to create and can accommodate anywhere from a small group of friends to massive communities with thousands of members. They offer flexibility in organization, moderation tools, and customization options that make them suitable for virtually any type of group or community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96AZHQ9EJVPG49MNJ2\">Understanding Different Types of Servers</h1>\n<p>Discord offers two main server types, each designed for different community needs and scales:</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96THW43XKZDGD1FRBX\">Friend Servers</h2>\n<p><strong>Friend servers</strong> are private, invite-only spaces perfect for staying connected with your close friends or smaller groups. These servers provide an intimate environment where you can chat, share memories, coordinate activities, and maintain relationships with people you know personally. The smaller scale makes them ideal for casual conversations and personal connections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT970XC7203923YRMKY4\">Community Servers</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community servers</a></strong> are larger, invite-only spaces designed to bring together people from around the world who share common interests, hobbies, or goals. These servers focus on fostering learning, discussion, and connection within specific communities—whether that's gaming, art, technology, or countless other topics.</p>\n<p>Community servers come with enhanced moderation tools to help manage larger groups effectively, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032807371-Server-Insights-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Insights</a>: Analytics to understand your community's activity, growth patterns, and member engagement</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10989121220631-How-to-Protect-Your-Server-from-Raids-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raid Protection</a>: Advanced security features to protect against spam, bot attacks, and disruptive behavior</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rules</a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onboarding</a>: Structured systems to welcome new members, establish community guidelines, and create screening processes</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591-Community-Server-Welcome-Screen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Welcome Screen</a>: Customizable introduction for new members</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Discovery</a>: Ability to be found in Discord's server discovery feature (if eligible)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tools make Community servers well-suited for building thriving, organized communities that can scale while maintaining a positive environment for all members.</p>\n<div class=\"book-box\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Want to learn more?</strong></span>\n<p id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BP8PBTQ3YKA0476J2\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">For a deeper dive into server types and their specific features, check out our comprehensive </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14078261239831-Clarifying-Server-Types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clarifying Server Types article</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">, which covers additional details and best practices for choosing the right server type for your community.</span></p>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BFSEDK3NH6EJ1ADQK\">Getting Started with Discord Servers</h1>\n<p>Creating your first Discord server is a simple process that takes just a few minutes.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.
