This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

No Nitro or server boosts required!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How long does the HD Splash Potion last?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Once used, the HD Splash Potion will grant 12 hours of HD streaming quality in the channel where it was activated. Anyone who joins the designated channel will enjoy HD streaming until the potion’s effect expires.</p>\n<p>You can still control your streaming quality at any time. For instance, if you notice your device’s performance struggling, you can adjust the streaming quality in the Share Your Screen pop out.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does everyone in the channel need to have or use a HD Splash Potion to enjoy HD streaming quality?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope! Just one person needs to use their potion in a designated channel to grant everyone in that channel the ability to benefit from HD streaming quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need to be friends with the potion user to receive HD streaming from the potion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Not at all! Once someone uses their HD Splash potion in a channel, anyone can enjoy HD streaming quality in that designated channel, regardless of friendship status.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens when the 12 hours are up?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Once the time is up, HD streaming quality in the designated channel will return to its standard quality for anyone without an active Nitro subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I move the HD Splash effect from my potion to a different channel after I’ve activated it in one channel?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope. The HD Splash potion will only grant its effect in the channel where it was used. Choose the voice channel carefully before activating the potion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s your refund policy for the HD Splash Potion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Potions are non-refundable—we’re unable to refund potions after purchase or use.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if a person with low bandwidth is watching my HD Splash Potion stream?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The effect of the HD Splash Potion can be impacted by the technical limitations of your or your fellow streamers' device or bandwidth. HD streaming capability may be limited if people watching your stream have low bandwidth or are tuning in from an unsupported device. To ensure that everyone in the call can benefit from the HD Splash Potion, make sure everyone in the call has a strong internet connection and is watching from a desktop device.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JA8Q445N15CEYT0QYEMR65FN\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no!

This is similar to how purchases work with the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360055386693\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Play Store</a>. Here's what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Discord account used for the first-time purchase of a subscription will link to the Apple ID used for the purchase.</li>\n<li>Future iOS subscriptions will automatically apply to that same Discord account.</li>\n<li>You cannot purchase or manage multiple subscriptions for two different Discord accounts through iOS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to purchase a Discord subscription on iOS for a different account than the one linked to your Apple account, there are a few options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try using a different device or Discord platform, such as the desktop app, to purchase the subscription on the secondary Discord account. </li>\n<li>If you're not using your original Discord account, you can cancel the subscription tied to it and delete the account. Once both steps are complete, you will be able to use your Apple ID on the new account. <strong>Please note:</strong> the account deletion process will take up to 15 days to complete.

Then, your Nitro Credits will activate automatically, lasting for the time you've earned. Once your Nitro Credits have been fully used, your paid Nitro subscription will automatically renew again.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’m a current Nitro subscriber. What happens to my billing date if I earn Nitro credits?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your billing date will be adjusted to reflect any additional time earned through Nitro Credits. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: I have active Server Boosts with my current Nitro subscription. What happens to these Boosts if I activate my Nitro Credits?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your existing Server Boosts will remain active and unchanged. While Nitro Credits are active, you’ll be able to transfer your Boosts between servers as long as it follows the normal cooldown periods. See our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boost FAQ</a> for more information.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I purchase new Server Boosts when Nitro Credits are active?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you won’t be able to purchase new Server Boosts when Nitro credits are active. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I cancel any Server Boost subscriptions I have while Nitro Credits are active?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you won’t be able to cancel any pre-existing Boost subscriptions until your Nitro Credits have been completely used. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I earn Nitro Credits when my subscription is past due?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're rewarded Nitro Credits while your subscription is past due, they will be applied in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If no successful payment is made during the 30-day grace period, the credits will be applied after the grace period ends.</li>\n<li>If a payment is successful, the credits will be applied at your next billing cycle. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use my earned Nitro Credits at any time?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nitro Credits activate between billing cycles. They will automatically apply once your current subscription period ends. If you don’t have an active Nitro subscription, your Nitro Credits will be activated immediately upon earning them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do Nitro Credits interact with Subscription Credits (Gifts)?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The interaction between Nitro Credits and Subscription Credits depends on your specific situation. Here are some common scenarios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Active gift credit, no stored credits:</strong> Nitro Credits activate after current gift period ends.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Multiple stored gift credits with an active subscription:</strong> Nitro Credits activate after the current billing period. Then, the next gift credit will be used to continue the subscription.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stored gift credits, no active subscription:</strong> Nitro Credits activate immediately. Doesn't affect existing gift credits.</li>\n</ol>"

The current server owner has 7 days to respond to our inquiry. If they approve the transfer or they don’t respond within 7 days, we transfer the server if eligible per our requirements. If the current owner denies the transfer request or the criteria for transfer is not met, we will not be able to proceed with the transfer of the server.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7F85Q2GC0CWCWTRMWYP5J38\">A Note on Data and Your Privacy</h1>\n<p>In line with data minimization principles, information provided by you in your server ownership transfer request will be deleted after the transfer is complete.</p>\n<p>We take your privacy and data security seriously. The information collected during the server ownership transfer process, including the server name, server ID, inactive owner's Discord username and user ID, and the new owner's Discord username and user ID, will be used solely for processing your transfer request.
