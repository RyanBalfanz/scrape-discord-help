These sellers often advertise through unsolicited messages, social media, or unofficial websites. To identify them, look for offers that require external payments, unusual URLs, or methods that don’t involve the Discord app or official Amazon store. Remember: if it’s not from a Discord source described in this article, it’s not official.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What does a phishing attempt look like?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Phishing attempts often appear as fake messages or links designed to trick you into providing sensitive information, like your login credentials or payment details. Common signs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Messages claiming you’ve won or received free products or rewards, like Nitro, but requiring you to click a suspicious link.</li>\n<li>Threats to your account status unless you take immediate action.</li>\n<li>Requests for your password, account login, or personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Discord will never ask for your login details or for your payment information through unsolicited messages. Always verify links and contact <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord support</a> directly if you’re unsure.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are safe messaging practices to avoid unsolicited scams?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> To protect yourself from unsolicited messages and scams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid engaging with messages from unknown users, especially those offering deals or rewards.</li>\n<li>Enable <strong>Safe Direct Messaging</strong> under <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> to automatically scan DMs from non-friends for harmful content.</li>\n<li>Report suspicious messages or users by following the steps outlined <a href=\"https://dis.gd/howtoreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Never click on links from untrusted sources.

Ensure that the billing address associated with the card being charged is current and matches the information filed with your bank.

Depending on the card, ensure there are sufficient funds in the account or that the credit limit hasn’t been exceeded.</p>\n<p>5. It’s possible a pre-set spending limit on the card was reached. Double-check if a spending limit has been set.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> If issues persist after following the steps above, Discord's Support team cannot provide further assistance.

Can I also take part in this promotion? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you previously had a Discord Nitro membership at any point on your accounts and have had a Nitro Classic or Nitro Basic membership in the past 12 months, you are ineligible to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p>If you have had a Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting membership active on your account and you’ve never had a Nitro membership,  you will be able to redeem this promotion and replace it with the 1 month Nitro membership.</p>\n<div class=\"warn-box\">\n<strong>HOWEVER, please note</strong>: By choosing to activate this 1 month trial, you will lose any features associated with your current memberships, and **you will not receive a refund for any remaining value on your current membership**.</div>\n<p>At the end of the promotion period, you'll be converted to a paying Nitro membership per month unless you cancel your membership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JCRXH6J496J1SDS9N4DHFGX1\">Payment Info and Membership Questions</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a membership plan, at the end of your 1 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p>\n<p>However, you can cancel the Nitro membership at any time before the end of the 1 month.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JCRXH6J4HYMEW3BX91W3EWCT\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro membership so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month perk.</p>\n<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a \"This gift has been claimed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if you are given an invalid promo and we will not be able to provide a new promo.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error when I click on “Next”.</strong></p>\n<p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are ineligible for this promotion</li>\n<li>The promotion is invalid</li>\n<li>The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>\n<li>The link is invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem. See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p>\n<p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified. Make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift.”</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like your email isn’t verified, make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift” error, you are trying to redeem this Nitro promotion on a Discord account with an email that hasn’t been verified yet.</p>\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/213219267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this support article</a> on how to resend the email verification for your Discord account.

Once someone uses their HD Splash potion in a channel, anyone can enjoy HD streaming quality in that designated channel, regardless of friendship status.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens when the 12 hours are up?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Once the time is up, HD streaming quality in the designated channel will return to its standard quality for anyone without an active Nitro subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I move the HD Splash effect from my potion to a different channel after I’ve activated it in one channel?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope. The HD Splash potion will only grant its effect in the channel where it was used. Choose the voice channel carefully before activating the potion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s your refund policy for the HD Splash Potion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Potions are non-refundable—we’re unable to refund potions after purchase or use.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if a person with low bandwidth is watching my HD Splash Potion stream?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The effect of the HD Splash Potion can be impacted by the technical limitations of your or your fellow streamers' device or bandwidth. HD streaming capability may be limited if people watching your stream have low bandwidth or are tuning in from an unsupported device. To ensure that everyone in the call can benefit from the HD Splash Potion, make sure everyone in the call has a strong internet connection and is watching from a desktop device.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JA8Q445N15CEYT0QYEMR65FN\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!
