If you’re a new Nitro member, you’ll be able to share Nitro trials with others after 5 days.<br>Additionally, you may not see it due to the eligibility criteria for Nitro members. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens after I share all 3 of my trials? </strong></p>\n<p>A: As a Nitro member, you’ll get more trials to share in the future. Keep an eye on the Share Nitro banner in <strong>Direct Messages &gt; Nitro </strong>for when you get a refresh! </p>\n<p><strong>Q: As a Nitro member, do my trials expire?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, your trials will not expire so long as you have an active Nitro membership. Once a trial is redeemed by a friend, you won’t be able to share another until you get more - or you have some left over that were not previously redeemed. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: As a trial recipient, will I be charged for redeeming a gifted trial?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You <strong>will not</strong> be charged for redeeming a shared trial. However, once your trial period ends, you will be charged for the plan that you signed up for during the Start Trial process. </p>\n<p>If you don’t cancel during your 2-week trial, you<strong> will </strong>automatically be charged the price associated with your selected plan after your trial ends. Cancel anytime during your trial to avoid being charged after your trial period in <strong>User Settings &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Cancel</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What devices is this available on?</strong><strong><br></strong>A: Sharing and redeeming Nitro trials is only available on the desktop app and browser. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there a way to revoke or decline a shared trial? </strong></p>\n<p>A: There isn't a way to revoke or decline a shared trial, so if you're sharing a trial with a friend, double check to make sure it's the right person!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if someone doesn’t redeem the Nitro trial I shared with them?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Recipients have up to <strong>10 days </strong>to redeem their trial. If the recipient doesn’t redeem your Nitro trial by that time, the trial will be sent back to you automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How will I know if the trial I’m receiving is legit and not a scam?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If someone is sharing a Nitro trial with you, it must appear as such in your direct messages with them:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22898504772247\" width=\"624\" height=\"147\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-left\"><strong>IMPORTANT: This is NOT a link, file, image attachment, program, nor a QR code</strong>! <br>Beware of bad actors asking you to redeem a Nitro trial by pressing a suspicious scam link, downloading a program, or scanning QR codes.

This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro membership so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on. Or you can give the promotion gift to a friend who hasn't had Nitro before.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month perk. However, this promotion gift can be gifted to a friend.</p>\n<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a \"This gift has been claimed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p>\n<p>If you received this promotion gift from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact Nitro gift code to make sure that it matches the code they claimed.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid Nitro gift code and we will not be able to provide a new gift.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error when I click on “Next”.</strong></p>\n<p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are ineligible for this promotion</li>\n<li>The promotion is invalid</li>\n<li>The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>\n<li>The gift code is invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem. See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p>\n<p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified.

These apps can range from bots that automate tasks, to activities that allow you to play games, collaborate on projects, or share experiences with others directly within Discord. </p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-1535fe26-7fff-4baf-b0cb-a3bdffa72cf6\">Apps are created by Discord, third parties, or by Discord users and can vary from games to moderation to everything else in between.

Most support servers can be found within the app’s <strong>Overview</strong> section within the <strong>App Directory</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Who is able to manage apps in a server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: To manage apps in a server, you must be the owner of the server or have the <strong>Manage Server </strong>permissions enabled. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: I no longer want the app in my server. How do I remove the app? </strong></p>\n<p>A: To remove the app, right-click the app’s bot within the <strong>Members list</strong> and <strong>kick</strong> the bot. By kicking the bot from the server, the app will be removed. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where can I use Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Currently, most apps are only available for use in servers if someone with permissions has added them for members to use. We want it to be easier for users to access apps, so we're experimenting with a way for users to add apps to their own account to use in spaces they're in across Discord.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I install an app to my account?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Some apps can be installed to your account directly, instead of a server. Some developers will be updating their apps to enable this functionality. If you see an app that has this feature enabled, feel free to add the app to your account! Please note that apps that are added to your account may not have all the same capabilities as apps added to a server. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-cf15afc3-7fff-8075-4179-9269217bfb89\">During this testing phase in servers with more than 25 members, only you will be able to see an app's response to your application command.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do user installed apps have access to data about my server or DM, or the people in it?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, these apps installed to your account are not able to access information about your server or DMs. They also do not have permissions to take action in your server or DMs, other than responding to your interactions. Additionally,  user installed apps are not able to get information about members of your servers or DMs that have not used the app. If a user does choose to interact with the app (e.g., through buttons and select menus), then the app can access their basic user information, like their username and <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guild member information</a> (if in a server). </p>\n<p>Please refer to the app’s developer or its privacy policy to learn more about its data practices. You can also learn more about data access by apps installed in servers generally <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7933951485975-Visibility-of-Bot-Data-Access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>"

Any time someone sends a message, Discord shows a little white dot next to the channel and server to let you know a new message has been sent.</p>\n<p>It can be information overload, and so naturally you take the only action you can and mute the server. Problem solved, right?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it becomes harder to pay attention to the 1 or 2 channels you really like on that specific server. You start missing out on moments because it’s muted. You have to try to remember to go back to that server and check those specific channels. But what if you forget? </p>\n<p>If this sounds familiar, we have good news! Discord is introducing a “middle ground” setting between “show me everything” and “show me nothing”. Let’s go over this setting a little bit more.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2NDX2BVBJT724Y9TC\">How to setup the new notification feature</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T25RJ9DM6RFVHDESSQ\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">This experiment is available on both the desktop and mobile app, however, the below modal will only pop-up in the desktop app.</span></h3>\n<p>If this experimental feature becomes available to you, Discord will help you get started by showing this modal the next time you launch Discord.</p>\n<p>Just follow the prompts and select which servers have the most important updates for you!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266097815\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></p>\n<p>It will also help explain what has changed and give you a chance to pick and choose some servers that you want to try this feature out on right away. </p>\n<p>We recommend trying it on servers that might overwhelm you, but have channels you’re interested in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2YFE1F7MYV75QA4HV\">Notification Settings</h2>\n<p>Let’s go over how this feature affects each type of notification setting and then how to set a Custom setting on both desktop and mobile.</p>\n<p><strong>All Messages</strong>: When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>All Messages</strong>, everything will behave exactly like before: The channel is highlighted in white, and both the channel and server show a little white dot next to them.</p>\n<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message in the channel.</p>\n<p><strong>@Mentions</strong> (a.k.a. Only Mentions): When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>@Mentions</strong>, the channel is not highlighted. Instead the channel stays the same color, and shows a light gray dot next to it. It gives you a hint of activity, but doesn’t try to compel you to check in on the channel. </p>\n<p>Most importantly the server does not show a white or gray dot at all! This allows you to check these channels on your own schedule, instead of being nagged to check them right away.</p>\n<p>If someone mentions you in this channel though, the channel will be highlighted in white, and both the server and channel will have a red badge so you know something important happened.</p>\n<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message that mentions you in the channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Nothing: </strong>When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to “Nothing”, the channel and server will behave the same way as @Mentions, however you will never receive a notification from this channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>\n<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>\n<p>2. Right-click on the channel and then navigate to <strong>Notifications</strong> and then tap on <strong>Custom.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266099479\" width=\"395\" height=\"407\"></strong></p>\n<p>If you select the <strong>Custom</strong> option, this allows you to change each behavior independently, such as how should Discord display that there are new messages and when should Discord notify you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile</strong></p>\n<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>\n<p>2. Long press on the channel you want to adjust the settings for then tap on <strong>Notification Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>3.

Instead of muting them, now you can pick and choose the channels you care about most, without being notified to visit the other channels. It’s like a better way of muting! This setting allows you to ignore everything by default while picking the specific channels you care about in a server.</p>\n<p>For example: Do you want to know when there’s a new update to a game you play or an update to an app you use? You can set that server to <strong>Mentions Only</strong>, and then  select the channel with release announcements to <strong>All Messages</strong>! Now you’ll get notified about that one channel, without getting overwhelmed by the rest of the server.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2EA493Y2Y4HFXZPNP\">How do I turn this feature off?</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2F8Y8CZKACQJT1YDF\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">The option to disable this feature is only on the desktop app.</span></h3>\n<p>If you do not want to use this feature, here is how to disable it.</p>\n<p>1.

      "body": "<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Discord is committed to cultivating belonging and striving for excellence by treating all workers with respect, ensuring safe working conditions, being environmentally responsible, and leading with integrity and good faith ethical practices. We expect our suppliers and their subsidiaries, affiliates, and subcontractors (“<strong>Suppliers</strong>”) to operate their businesses with social, ethical, and environmental responsibility and integrity.  This Supplier Code of Conduct describes the legal, environmental, and social obligations for our Suppliers. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6GS2NZDCQF422231EY\">1. Compliance</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">When providing goods and services to Discord, Suppliers are required to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations. They must also meet the expectations outlined in this Supplier Code of Conduct, along with any contractual requirements and additional terms.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Suppliers are expected to maintain a system designed to enable its operations to conform to the standards in this Supplier Code of Conduct and also record, identify, mitigate, and remediate any gaps and operational risks.  Upon request from Discord, Suppliers will accurately disclose information regarding their labor, health and safety, environmental practices, business activities, structure, financial situation, and performance, in accordance with prevailing industry practices. Suppliers will also allow and enable Discord (and any third party representing Discord) to assess a Supplier’s compliance with this Supplier Code of Conduct by inspecting and reviewing the Supplier’s facilities, practices, policies, and relevant records without notice and interviewing personnel without disruption or monitoring. Suppliers will communicate clear and accurate information about their practices, policies, and expectations to their workers, next-tier supplier(s), and customers, and will train their employees on their requirements under this Supplier Code of Conduct.  Suppliers will promptly implement reasonable corrective action to remedy any material non-conformance identified by Discord. Though we might seek to work with Suppliers to improve conditions, we also may terminate our relationship with any Supplier that fails to meet any of these responsibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6GW4ZCNT78380RDQDV\">2. Labor and Human Rights</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">At Discord, we firmly believe in treating all workers with respect and dignity. We hold our Suppliers to the same standard and expect them to prioritize the well-being of their workers. This includes ensuring that all workers, regardless of their employment type, are treated with human decency.  Our Suppliers must adhere to the following standards in their operations:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>No Forced Labor.  </strong> Suppliers will not use forced, bonded (including debt bondage), indentured, or involuntary prison labor, and will not engage in slavery or trafficking of any person.  No matter the situation, all work must be voluntary, and workers should be able terminate their employment at any time. Suppliers will not require workers to pay any recruitment or employment fees or expenses.  Suppliers will ensure that workers always have access to their identity, immigration, or work permit documents. This means Suppliers may not hold, destroy, conceal, or confiscate identity or immigration documents, such as  government-issued identification, passports, or work permits. Suppliers can only hold  documentation if required by law. Even so, workers should never be denied access to their documents.  Suppliers should make sure that each worker receives a written agreement describing the terms of employment, and if there is international relocation involved, the agreement must be given and signed prior to the relocation.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>No Child Labor</strong>.  Suppliers will not use child labor. “Child” means any person under age 15, under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. Workers under the age of 18 will not perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, including night shifts, overtime, or physically or psychologically demanding work. In the absence of local law, suppliers must pay student workers, interns, and apprentices at least the same wage rates as other entry-level workers performing equal or similar tasks.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Wages.  </strong>Suppliers will pay legally-mandated wages and benefits and comply with the law regarding wage deductions. Suppliers must also provide workers with the basis on which workers are paid via pay stub or similar documentation. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure is not permitted.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Working Hours</strong>. Except in emergency situations, Suppliers will set a maximum of 60 hours per week (including overtime) for any workers paid on an hourly basis.  Workers should be allowed at least one day off every seven days. All overtime hours must be voluntary.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Abuse, Discrimination, and Harassment</strong>. Suppliers will not discriminate in screening, hiring, or employment practices based on race, color, age, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnicity, national origin, caste, disability, genetic information, medical condition, pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership, covered veteran status, or any other category protected by applicable law. Workers’ religious practices should be reasonably accommodated.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Fostering Diversity</strong>. Because diversity, equity, and inclusion is crucial to us, our Suppliers must also demonstrate a commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion in all aspects of the workplace. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Freedom of Association.</strong>  Suppliers will respect workers rights to associate freely, bargain collectively, and seek representation in accordance with local laws. Suppliers are expected to permit workers to openly communicate and share grievances with management without fear of reprisal, intimidation, discrimination, or harassment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6G5BJ8P74N9SPE1D72\">3. Health &amp; Safety</h1>\n<p>Suppliers must ensure that all operations happen in healthy and safe working conditions for its workers.  Suppliers will further ensure that the following requirements are met:</p>\n<p>Occupational Safety and Health. Suppliers will comply with all applicable safety and health laws and regulations.  Suppliers will identify, evaluate, and control worker exposure to safety and health hazards, such as chemical, biological, physical, and ergonomic stressors, and other elements of physically demanding work, through proper design, engineering controls, maintenance, safe work procedures, and ongoing health and safety guidance. Suppliers must also identify, evaluate, and control worker exposure to the hazards of physically demanding tasks, including manual material handling and heavy or repetitive lifting, prolonged standing, and highly repetitive or forceful assembly tasks. When these methods cannot adequately control risks, suppliers must provide workers with personal protective gear and education about the risks involved in the language of the worker or in a language the worker can understand.  Suppliers will implement procedures to prevent, manage, track, and report occupational injury and illness. </p>\n<p>Machine Safeguarding. Production and other machinery shall be evaluated for safety hazards. Physical guards,  interlocks, and barriers are to be provided and properly maintained where machinery  presents an injury hazard to workers.</p>\n<p>Emergency Preparedness. Suppliers will identify and plan for potential emergencies, and Suppliers will implement emergency plans and provide guidance to workers on emergency response procedures, including emergency reporting, worker notification and evacuation, drills, fire detection and suppression equipment, exit facilities, and recovery plans in accordance with local law.</p>\n<p>Sanitation, Food, and Housing. Suppliers will provide workers with ready access to clean toilet facilities, potable water, and sanitary food preparation, storage, and eating facilities. If Suppliers provide workers with housing, those facilities will be clean and safe, including but not limited to adequate personal space, entry and exit privileges, emergency egresses, heat and ventilation, adequate lighting, and hot water for bathing and showering.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6GQAFMR6E0FVZFX6NT\">4. Environmental</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We expect that our Suppliers will strive to create regenerative processes to minimize adverse effects on the community, environment, and natural resources while safeguarding the health and safety of the public. This includes the following:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Environmental Permits and Reporting.</strong> Suppliers will obtain and keep current all required environmental permits, approvals, and registrations and follow their operational and reporting requirements.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Resource Efficiency and Clean Energy</strong>. Suppliers will work to reduce consumption of resources, including raw materials, energy, and water. Suppliers will seek to minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and use cleaner sources of energy.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Hazardous and Restricted Substances</strong>. Suppliers will manage chemicals and other materials that pose a hazard to the environment to ensure their safe handling, use, storage, and disposal. Suppliers will identify, monitor, control, treat, and reduce hazardous air emissions, wastewater, and waste generated from its operations.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Waste Mitigation</strong>. Suppliers will work to reduce or eliminate waste of all types. Where waste cannot be eliminated, Suppliers will manage all waste streams in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and in an environmentally responsible and secure way; this includes, but is not limited to, preventing illegal discharges and spills from entering storm drains and treating as required prior to discharge or disposal of all wastewater and solid waste from operations, industrial processes, and sanitation facilities.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Air Emissions. </strong>Suppliers will characterize, monitor, control, and treat air generated by its operations prior to discharge.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Materials Restrictions. </strong>Suppliers are to adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, and customer requirements regarding the prohibition or restriction of specific substances in products and manufacturing, including labeling for recycling and disposal. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Water Management. </strong>Supplier shall implement a water management program that documents, characterizes, and monitors water sources, use and discharge; seeks opportunities to conserve water; and controls channels of contamination. All wastewater is to be characterized, monitored, controlled, and treated as required prior to discharge or disposal.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6G39HTKA98AD6V4B6W\">5. Ethics</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Discord places a strong emphasis on upholding ethical standards to promote honesty and integrity in business operations. Our Suppliers are expected to comply with all requirements listed below:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Conflicts</strong>. Suppliers will avoid actual or apparent conflicts of interest in their work with Discord.  Suppliers will immediately disclose any known family or other close personal relationships with Discord’s employees who have an influence over their engagements with Discord. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Gifts</strong>.  If Suppliers extend any business courtesies to our employees, they will do so infrequently, and the courtesies must be of no more than moderate value. Suppliers will also accurately reflect their business dealings in their books and records. Suppliers will have a zero-tolerance policy that prohibits all forms of bribery (covering promising, offering, giving, or accepting any bribes), corruption, extortion, fraud, and embezzlement, and will implement monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure conformance with anti-corruption laws. Suppliers will not make illegal payments directly or indirectly. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Intellectual Property</strong>. Suppliers will respect intellectual property rights and the confidential information of others. Suppliers will conduct technology and know-how transfers in a manner protecting intellectual property rights and confidential information.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Privacy and Information Security</strong>. Suppliers will protect the privacy of personal information of everyone with whom they do business, including suppliers, customers, consumers, and workers.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Responsible Materials Sourcing</strong>. Suppliers will maintain a policy reasonably assuring that any tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold in products they manufacture does not directly or indirectly benefit armed groups that commit human rights abuses, including in or near the Democratic Republic of Congo. Suppliers will exercise, and will make available to us upon request, due diligence on the source and chain of custody of these minerals.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Fair Business, Advertising &amp; Competition.</strong> Suppliers must obey applicable laws and industry and regulatory standards of fair business, advertising, and competition.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6H2XTREXGJRF3YGDJW\">6. Accessibility.  </h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Discord is committed to incorporating accessibility into the design of its products (learn more here: <a href=\"https://discord.com/accessibility-statement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://discord.com/accessibility-statement</a>).  Suppliers will embed relevant web accessibility standards, innovation, and best practices to deliver inclusive products and services for our users and stakeholders.</p>"

You can easily do all that and more in voice channels! Learn more about not only how to create a voice channel for you and your friends, but also so much more about voice channels!</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGXJWRPAM7ZBDKJ75B0NWQ4G\">What are Voice Channels?</h1>\n<p>A voice channel is a channel in a server where users can connect and chat with one another. You can always tell what channel is a voice channel versus a text channel because a voice channel will be indicated by a speaker icon [<img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19583605640471\" width=\"20\" height=\"18\">].</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGXJWRPAZBM3FY6333C9WBQ3\">How to create Voice Channels in a server</h1>\n<p>There are 2 ways to create a voice channel in a server. Let’s go over both!</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>\n<p>1. First, tap on the plus (+) next to a channel category in the Discord server you want to make the new channel in.</p>\n<p>2. Then tap on <strong>Voice </strong>and enter a name for the new channel.</p>\n<p>3. Tap on <strong>Create Channel</strong> when you’re ready to create the channel.</p>\n<p>4. Congratulations! You now have a new voice channel in your server. If you want to move the channel, you can drag and drop the channel to another category. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19583620392727\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></p>\n<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>\n<p>1. Right-click on the channel list in the Discord server you want to make the new channel in.</p>\n<p>2. Then tap on <strong>Voice </strong>and enter a name for the new channel.</p>\n<p>3. Tap on <strong>Create Channel</strong> when you’re ready to create the channel.</p>\n<p>4. Congratulations! You now have a new voice channel in your server. Creating the channel this way will position the voice channel at the very top, so you can drag and drop the voice channel to move it to a category.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19583634370583\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HGXJWRPA55H4PRWCP622JNJJ\">Role permissions for adding a Voice Channel</h2>\n<p>In order to create voice channels in the Discord server, you either need to be the Server Owner or have Moderator permissions set up. Here’s how to set up role permissions so your Moderators can also create channels.</p>\n<p>1. Navigate to the server that you want to change settings for then tap on the server name in the top-left corner of the app.</p>\n<p>2. Tap on <strong>Server Settings </strong>and then head to <strong>Roles</strong>.</p>\n<p>3. Now tap on the role that you wish to edit.</p>\n<p>4. Finally, tap on the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab and locate the <strong>Manage Channels</strong> permission. If enabled, this role will be able to delete and create text and voice channels. A check mark indicates the setting is enabled, an x means it’s disabled for this role.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19583605654039\" width=\"467\" height=\"82\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HGXJWRPAD3XEYBF3A3Q0CM8H\">How to join a Voice Channel in a server</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HGXJWRPAXDMCHDV9VGMX04WX\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">If a voice channel has a lock icon on it, it means you do not have permissions to join the channel.</span></h3>\n<p>1.
