To change the sound effects and their volumes, look for suggested soundscapes by tapping on the white circles around the scene to increase or decrease the volume of an individual soundscape. Otherwise, tap the slider icon in the media controls for a list of soundscapes to adjust. Changing the soundscapes and their volume will change it for all users in the same Lofi Activity.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcFK1f794LjxFuJqYNBfjQq4PoZwffGvEKhsf8mtTs8roBKUk5BpI9Xtv32Xmxs2CwrSKIXfRr5G3KtxQO_oUsPKFxXW6gV2EuwwvveWnYNlTKJNDbhjwHO5n2BPfqOC1k6KJ9z3eCq9hPlNEoNqh-1oN_0?key=xTQCI6eaTnIzJThPzaHwdQ\" width=\"624\" height=\"352\"></p>\n<p>2. To adjust the activity volume itself, use the global volume slider in the lower right corner. This will only impact the volume for the person adjusting their volume and not all other listeners in the same Activity.</p>\n<p>3. Users can select different scenes using the <strong>Scenes</strong> button in the UI Menu. Use the left and right buttons to scroll through the options. Changing a scene will change it for all users in the same Lofi Activity.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfgOAP3_uf60-yEIFTJEbOOu-gWeAINPwi4eq9B51y_QvletfD8Sc8YGRj46MMoPdv54fYdRUym0vmRr4nhnkFrXLUPwlhIGMLlkyRmms_cptzkWLxZxSaTN4vY8M6kFPlmpzgbVEg5I9kTiF1YGaKXAceJ?key=xTQCI6eaTnIzJThPzaHwdQ\" width=\"624\" height=\"352\"></p>\n<p>4. Users can start, pause, or go to the next music track using the media controls at the bottom of the screen. View local time and date by tapping on the clock in the bottom-left corner. If the scene allows, scenes can adjust from day to night using the toggle also in the bottom-left corner. Changing, pausing, and starting the music track will do the same for all players in the same Lofi Activity.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26327734364695\" width=\"624\" height=\"352\"></p>\n<p>5.

To enhance the gameplay experience, Discord Activities access and temporarily store the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discord ID</li>\n<li>Avatar</li>\n<li>Username</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Activities played in a single session, user data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Deleting your data will remove all of your progression across these Discord-developed activities.</div>\n<p><strong>Q: My question isn't listed, what do I do?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If all is lost, please submit a ticket to our support team at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/contact</a></p>"

While here, you will be able to view the Multi-Factor Authentication options under the <strong>Password and Authentication </strong>section.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26407339587223\" width=\"624\" height=\"484\"></p>\n<p>3. Press the <strong>Enable Authenticator App</strong> button to get started. To begin the authenticator process, you will have to download<a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Google Authenticator</a> app or the Authy app on your mobile device. After you’ve downloaded an Authenticator App, open it on your mobile device and use the camera function to scan the QR code in the Discord app.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26407294011671\" width=\"520\" height=\"568\"></p>\n<p>4. After scanning the QR code that is displayed in the Discord app, your Authenticator App will generate a 6 digit code. Enter that 6 digit code into “<strong>Login with your code</strong>” and then tap on <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26407294012567\" width=\"524\" height=\"499\"></p>\n<p>5. You can now link your phone number to your account to help act as a backup method for obtaining these authentication codes. This can help you be less worried about losing access to your Authenticator App, but reduces how secure your account is.</p>\n<p>6. After enabling an Authenticator App, the Discord app will also have a list of backup codes for login: each of these can be used once instead of a code generated by your app, in case you lose access to it. Make sure to <strong>download and store these backup codes </strong>in a safe, easily accessible place! If you lose these, Discord can’t help you get back into your account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7XYH0C40926NMP8V7HH1W2A\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">If you set up your Authenticator App through Authy, you can set up a backup by following </span><a href=\"https://authy.com/blog/how-the-authy-two-factor-backups-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> steps.

This added layer of security for audio and video calls gives visual confirmation that no one else can listen in on your calls or watch your stream besides the intended participants/viewers.</p>\n<div class=\"mega-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> All audio and video conversations in direct messages (DMs), group messages (GDMs), voice channels, and Go Live streams on Discord will soon be end-to-end encrypted by default.</div>\n<p>Below explains how to verify that a call is end-to-end encrypted and how to confirm that the people who you are on a call with are verified too.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: Desktop and mobile calls between users with updated clients are end-to-end encrypted without any user action.</strong> The features described in this article do not “turn on” end-to-end encryption. We developed these features to show our work and help you confirm that our end-to-end encryption is functioning as intended.</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4F57TT88E7MHVTS47\">How to Verify That a Call is End-to-End Encrypted</h1>\n<p>You can verify that your voice call on Discord is end-to-end encrypted by checking the <strong>Voice/Video Details</strong> of the call.</p>\n<p>On the desktop app, open the <strong>Voice/Video Details</strong> in the bottom left corner of the app to see a new <strong>Privacy</strong> tab, as well as a <strong>green lock icon</strong> stating that your call is <strong>End-to-end encrypted</strong>. </p>\n<p>On the mobile app, you can find that <strong>green lock icon</strong> while in a voice call by pressing on the voice channel name in the top left corner of the focused voice call view.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336152838167\" width=\"279\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>Privacy</strong> tab contains the <strong>Voice Privacy Code</strong> for the call. Privacy codes can be compared with other voice call participants to confirm that everyone in the call sees the same code. Comparing codes should occur out-of-band, for example on a different communication platform.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>Privacy codes are long so we split them up into groups of five digits to make them easier to read.</div>\n<p>Privacy codes update when participants join or leave calls, so these codes must be compared at the same time with all current call participants in order to verify that the call is end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p>Each Go Live stream associated with a call also has a <strong>Stream Privacy Code </strong>that can be accessed via the context menu for the stream, which you can find by right-clicking directly on the Go Live stream and selecting it from the dropdown menu.</p>\n<p>By verifying the privacy code for the voice call or for any Go Live stream in the call, you can confirm that all participants have the same encrypted view of the call and that no unexpected participants have joined the call.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4RGNV5D9YRX2G30VM\">How to Verify Participants on a Call</h1>\n<p>Whether you’re on a call with your best friend, or a group of people in a voice channel on your favorite server, you can choose to verify the identity of the people you’re on a call with for an additional layer of privacy assurance. </p>\n<p>1. Navigate to “View Verification Code”. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>On Desktop, right click on the user in the voice call members list or right click on their tile in the call view and select <strong>View Verification Code</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>\n<li>On Mobile, open the user's profile either from the call member list or by long pressing on their call tile and then select <strong>View Verification Code</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2. You will then see a series of numbers that should match for both you and the person you’re on a call with. </p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>When you show the <strong>Verification Code</strong> for another participant, you may see a warning if you have previously verified that participant and the code has changed.</div>\n<p>3. Compare the codes out-of-band (via a different communication platform) with the person you’re speaking with.</p>\n<p>4. If the codes are a match, then you can select <strong>Mark as Verified</strong> to confirm that you have successfully verified who you are chatting with. </p>\n<p>Once you’ve verified each person in the call, a small icon will appear next to their name in the call to confirm this action is complete. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336147078423\" width=\"305\" height=\"356\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336147080471\" width=\"624\" height=\"256\"></p>\n<p>These codes are device-specific and change every time you join a new call with that person by default. With each new call, you will have to repeat the verification process. </p>\n<p>You can opt-in to persistent verification keys to make the verification others perform of your given device permanent. More information on how to do this in the next section.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>Verification Codes are long so we split them up into groups of five digits to make them easier to read.</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G47PAKXTQQTJ9QDZ40\">Persistent Verification Keys</h1>\n<p>To avoid repetitive verification each time you are on a call with the same person, you can enable persistent verification keys. If you have this setting enabled, people you’re speaking with will be able to remember your device and mark it as verified. </p>\n<p>To enable persistent verification keys: </p>\n<p>1. Navigate to <strong>User Settings, </strong>then select <strong>Privacy &amp; Settings</strong>. </p>\n<p>2. Select the <strong>Encryption </strong>tab, and toggle the <strong>Enable persistent verification codes</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336152844055\" width=\"624\" height=\"113\"></p>\n<p>Considerations for setup: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>For you to save a persistent verification key for the person you’re speaking with, they’ll need to have the <strong>Enable persistent verification codes</strong> setting enabled as well.</li>\n<li>Persistent verification keys are tied to your device, not your user account. This means that if both you and a friend enable this setting, you’ll remain verified to each other every time you join a voice call from those devices.</li>\n<li>If you log out and back in again on your device, you will lose access to any previously used persistent verification key on that device and others who previously persistently verified your device will see that you are unverified. If you want to use persistent verification keys, you will need to enable the <strong>Enable persistent verification codes</strong> setting again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Someone you previously persistently verified may appear unverified when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They’re using a different device than the one you persistently verified</li>\n<li>They had to log in again on the device you persistently verified</li>\n<li>Their persistent verification key was removed from local device storage</li>\n<li>They are being impersonated by someone else</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4ED1HCVY5NX29CJ58\">Managing Verified Devices</h1>\n<p>If you have verified other users with persistent verification codes enabled, you can manage these verified devices in your <strong>User Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Navigate to <strong>User Settings, </strong>then select <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong>. </p>\n<p>2. Select the <strong>Encryption </strong>tab where you’ll see <strong>Verified Devices</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">a. On Desktop, select the <strong>Encryption</strong> tab.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">b. On Mobile, select the <strong>End-to-end Encryption</strong> button on the <strong>User Settings</strong> tab.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336152847383\" width=\"521\" height=\"466\"></p>\n<p>Each user, along with their verified device(s), will be displayed. You can choose to remove the verification for a specific device, identified by the time it was verified, or remove all verifications for a specific user.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4ZJCDD1Y31ZXN24HB\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I know if my call is end-to-end encrypted?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You can verify that your call is end-to-end encrypted by checking for the green <strong>End-to-end encrypted lock icon</strong> in the <strong>Voice/Video Details</strong> on the desktop app or by pressing on the voice channel name details in the top left corner of the focused call view on mobile.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will E2EE A/V roll out to Discord web and consoles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Starting September 2024, all updated desktop and mobile Discord clients will support E2EE A/V. Web and consoles will receive E2EE A/V support in 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why is my call not end-to-end encrypted when I’m on an updated Discord app?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your call may not be end-to-end encrypted because you may be on a call with someone who is not on an updated Discord app. In 2025, all DMs, GDMs, voice channels, and Go Live streams will require updated clients that support end-to-end encryption.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I opt out of E2EE A/V?</strong></p>\n<p>A: E2EE A/V is enabled by default and cannot be turned off. E2EE A/V currently won’t apply to calls where an unsupported client (i.e., web and consoles) is being used by at least one user. Stage channels also will not be end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will the preview of my Go Live stream now be private for users not yet in the call?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Stream previews – when you are able to see a snippet of an ongoing Go Live stream - are NOT end-to-end encrypted. This means that users not in a call with an ongoing stream may be able to see a preview of the stream. You can<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> disable stream previews</a> forever, or on a per-stream basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I verify the end-to-end encryption status in Go Live streams?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, each Go Live stream has a <strong>Stream Privacy Code</strong> that can be accessed via the context menu for the stream. You can compare this code out of band with other participants to verify that the stream is end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I change my device/log into my Discord account on a new device?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you change your device and have persistent verification codes enabled, you will need to go through the <a href=\"#h_01J7M034G47PAKXTQQTJ9QDZ40\">verification process</a> again as verification is tied to the specific device. Persistent verification keys must be re-enabled on a new device.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br><br><br></p>"

The next time you sign in, you’ll be able to use that passkey for one-step login -<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Security-Keys-Passkeys-and-Passwordless-Login-on-Discord-85efa0b891b344568a19db6de47ccfed?pvs=21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> see below for more details</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J806DMWB4STCJ8RCKAEF3EV8\">How to Register Passkeys</h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J806DMWB9QF5TCRHQ2Z4EW1G\">Mobile</h2>\n<p>1.

And you’re done! Make sure to download and store your backup codes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J806DMWB8WRKBS04YXX47CJQ\">Desktop/Browser</h2>\n<p>1. Start by selecting the the cogwheel [<img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429353477399\" width=\"23\" height=\"24\">] next to your username.</p>\n<p>2. This will open your <strong>User Settings</strong> and take you to the <strong>My Account</strong> page. While here, you will be able to view the Multi-Factor Authentication options under the Password and Authentication section.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429353480343\" width=\"624\" height=\"473\"></p>\n<p>3. To set up a Security Key, select <strong>Register a Security Key</strong> and follow the prompts to reauthenticate.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365137047\" width=\"550\" height=\"359\"></p>\n<p>4. Tap <strong>Let’s go</strong> to start the Passkey enrollment process. You’ll be prompted by your operating system, if supported, to enroll a Passkey. On MacOS, it looks like this:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365137303\" width=\"489\" height=\"435\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>5. After enrolling MFA, the Discord app will also have a list of backup codes for login: each of these can be used once instead of a code generated by your app, in case you lose access to it. Make sure to <strong>download and store these backup codes!</strong> If you lose these, Discord can’t help you get back into your account.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365139351\" width=\"609\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>And you’re done!</p>\n<p>You can now register another Security Key on this device or a different device (you can have up to 16 security keys/passkeys at the same time).</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J806DMWBQWMCM3XC01X2PX61\">Passwordless Login with Passkeys</h1>\n<p>Using your passkey to log in is simple! As long as you have a password manager available with a passkey saved in it, you will be prompted to select a passkey. If you’re not getting prompted, you can always tap on <strong>Or, sign in with Passkey</strong> instead. Your system will prompt you to select the Passkey associated with your account and complete a challenge (e.g., Face ID), then you’re logged in!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429353488151\" width=\"624\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J806DMWB34KBHKM4XSWZ0FGM\">How to Use Security Keys</h1>\n<p>While Security Keys function similarly to passkeys, they generally cannot be used for one-step login on Discord. Fear not! You’ll still be able to use Security Keys as a form of MFA - when you log in, you’ll get an additional challenge after entering your username and password to use you security key:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365142807\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\"></p>\n<p>Press <strong>Authenticate with security key</strong> to interact with your Security Key, and you’re in!</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J806DMWBCY8EPFTCYAP1KEF7\">Passkey Troubleshooting</h1>\n<p>Having issues with your passkey when trying to log in? Here are some troubleshooting steps to try if your passkey isn’t working for any reason:</p>\n<p>First, try using your username and password to log in, then using your Passkey on the following MFA Challenge screen. If that doesn’t work, you’ll need to delete the existing Passkey from both your device and Discord account, then set it up once again. To do this:</p>\n<p>1. Make sure you have your Discord backup codes handy just in case. Open your password manager and remove the passkey from your saved credentials for Discord. Refer to your password manager’s documentation for details on how to do this.</p>\n<p>2. Use a different MFA method or device to complete the challenge. If you don’t have another set up, you can use a backup code from the list you saved to complete the MFA challenge and finish the login.</p>\n<p>3. Go to your Account Settings and repeat the enrollment process to register a new passkey with your password manager. See<a href=\"#h_01J806DMWB4STCJ8RCKAEF3EV8\"> How to Register Passkeys</a> above for more details, and be sure to remember what you name it!</p>\n<p>4. From the Account Settings screen, delete the old passkey associated with your Discord account.</p>\n<p>And now you’re starting fresh! Following these steps ensures your remaining saved backup codes continue to work while enrolling a new Passkey.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J6YTTK2CWV2YEDAGDTTR6FGV\">\n<strong>NOTE: </strong>Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J6YTTK2CFA5B3C1EJVV5BME5\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

      "body": "<p>We have paid attention to user feedback regarding the reliability of Discord’s Game Overlay, which has been known to occasionally cause problems during gameplay. Moreover, it is only supported in a limited number of games due to compatibility challenges inherent to the current implementation.</p>\n<p>As a result, on <strong>April 15, 2024</strong>, Discord started to roll-out a revamped Game Overlay designed to significantly enhance stability, reliability, and performance. The new Game Overlay will not interfere with your game, and is expected to be compatible with nearly all games. This is currently out to 100% of users on the Canary and PTB versions of the Discord app. There is no ETA at this time as to when this will be fully rolled out to all users on the Stable version of Discord.</p>\n<p>After this date, you will experience the following changes in Game Overlay behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game Overlay is now enabled by default for all games.</li>\n<li>Game Overlay will work in windowed fullscreen mode and windowed borderless fullscreen mode, but will not work in true fullscreen mode.\n<ul>\n<li>True fullscreen mode on desktop means that other computer applications cannot be displayed over the application that’s in true fullscreen mode.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Game Overlay will be hidden when the game window is not in focus.</li>\n<li>Screensharing the game window will not capture the Game Overlay, but screensharing the full screen will still capture the Game Overlay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J42RQ6P0QAC4P99CCMDFF134\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: What do I do if I always run my game in true fullscreen mode?</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>A: Most games support borderless fullscreen mode, so you can switch to this mode to continue getting Discord’s Game Overlay in game.</p>\n<p>If you need to run the game in true fullscreen mode for any reason, there’s also a global <strong>Enable legacy overlay</strong> option in <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Game Overlay</strong>. Please note that this option may be removed in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25289838883991\" width=\"668\" height=\"376\"><br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I keep using the legacy Game Overlay?</strong><br>A: You can continue using it as long as the option exists in the app, but our goal is to eventually move everyone over to the revamped Game Overlay so they can enjoy a more stable and performant experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if the game I play only works with the legacy Game Overlay?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Please first check that you are running borderless fullscreen mode, or sometimes called “windowed” fullscreen mode. The revamped Game Overlay should work in this mode.</p>\n<p>If you still experience issues with it, please reach out to our <a href=\"http://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Support team</a> for further assistance.</p>"

The disclosure should be prominent enough for consumers to view and understand it easily when they are reading posts.  Such disclosures will be: (a) unavoidable, (b) made in the same form and format of each type of endorsement (for example, if the post is a video of a person speaking, it should be superimposed on the video, spoken aloud, as well as in the video text description), and (c) at the beginning of the post (and if the post is livestreamed or longer than 60 seconds, repeatedly through the post). </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">2.2 By way of example, Discord requires that Provider include the following disclosures in a video: </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(a) a text description statement in the video description text, such as: “#ad”, “#sponsored” or “#Discordpartner”, “Discord agency employee”;</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(b) a verbal statement such as “This video is sponsored by Discord”;  and</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(c) text superimposed over the video, such as: “#ad”, “#sponsored” or “#Discordpartner”, “Discord agency employee.”</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Endorsement Content Requirements.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">3.1 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Honest Assessment</span>. Provider will ensure that it and any Influencers it engages only make statements that reflect honest and truthful opinions that are reflective of  Provider or Influencer’s (as applicable) actual experiences using Discord’s products and services. Provider will ensure that all Endorsement Content will clearly state that the views expressed do not represent the views of Discord (unless they were directed by Discord).  If a statement is one that Discord has instructed the Provider to post, Provider will ensure it or any Influencers it engages will make this fact clear to viewers.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">3.2 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Truthful and Accurate</span>. Provider will ensure it and any Influencers it engages only make factual statements about any Discord’s or a competitor’s services’ characteristic or quality, as verified by Discord, including all expressly stated or implied messaging.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">3.3 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quality Standards</span>. Provider will ensure that any statements made in connection with or in Endorsement Content will be consistent with the positive images and/or goodwill with which Discord wishes to associate, including ensuring Endorsement Content does not link to or include content that is sexual, violent, offensive or otherwise inappropriate for the audience for which it was intended.  Provider will ensure that Endorsement Content conforms with the Discord Community Guidelines available at <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://discord.com/guidelines</span></a> or other URL that Discord may provide from time to time.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>E-Mail and Electronic Messages. </strong>Unless expressly requested in writing, neither Provider nor any Influencers may send any emails/electronic messages on Discord’s behalf.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Influencers.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">5.1 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Engagement</span><strong>.  </strong>Provider will not engage, manage, or compensate Influencers for participating in any activity relating to Services unless expressly required under an applicable SOW. Provider will thoroughly screen all Influencers proposed to and engaged by Provider on Discord’s behalf. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">5.2 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Compliance</span>.  Provider will review all Endorsement Content to ensure compliance with the MSA and this Appendix. As between the parties, Provider is solely responsible for, and will ensure Influencers and Endorsement Content complies with the following:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(a) All applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including disclosures regarding advertising, paid, or sponsored content); </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(b) The terms of the MSA, including this Social Media Appendix; </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(c) The Discord Community Guidelines available at <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://discord.com/guidelines</span></a> or other URL that Discord may provide from time to time; and</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(d) Discord Branding Guidelines available at <a href=\"https://discord.com/branding\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://discord.com/branding</span></a> or other URL that Discord may provide from time to time.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">5.3 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Monitoring.</span> Provider will implement guidelines, rules, and protocols for reviewing and monitoring the activities of Influencers and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the MSA, including, without limitation, termination of any noncompliant Influencer’s participation in the campaign and association with Discord where appropriate.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Content Review. </strong>Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Discord, Provider will ensure that Discord reviews all Endorsement Content, including during the Endorsement Content’s conception (e.g., concepts and storyboards) prior to publication on Social Media.  For clarity, all Endorsement Content is subject to the approval and acceptance provisions set forth in the MSA. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Content Removal.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">7.1 Provider will immediately remove any content relating to Discord, its products or its services, those of its competitors or those associated with Discord, upon notice from Discord that it finds the content objectionable.  Further, Discord expects that Provider will promptly remove any content for which it receives a legitimate complaint or which Provider later becomes aware may be in violation of the law or otherwise violate third party rights.  </p>\n<p>7.2 If Provider finds that any Endorsement Content does not comply with any law or regulation, the terms of the MSA, any guideline or policy provided to it, or is otherwise objectionable,  Provider will: (i) immediately notify Discord; and (ii) use best efforts to ensure that the applicable Influencer immediately deletes or amends any non-compliant Endorsement Content.  Upon Discord’s request to remove or delete any Endorsement Content at any time for any reason, Provider will use best efforts to ensure that content is removed and deleted within as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after receiving the request.</p>"
