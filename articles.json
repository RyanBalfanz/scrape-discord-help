Think of servers as virtual meeting places that bring people together around shared interests, hobbies, or relationships. Each server is organized with different channels dedicated to specific purposes—whether that's text conversations, voice chats, or media sharing—making it easy to keep discussions organized and accessible.</p>\n<p>Discord servers are free to create and can accommodate anywhere from a small group of friends to massive communities with thousands of members. They offer flexibility in organization, moderation tools, and customization options that make them suitable for virtually any type of group or community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96AZHQ9EJVPG49MNJ2\">Understanding Different Types of Servers</h1>\n<p>Discord offers two main server types, each designed for different community needs and scales:</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96THW43XKZDGD1FRBX\">Friend Servers</h2>\n<p><strong>Friend servers</strong> are private, invite-only spaces perfect for staying connected with your close friends or smaller groups. These servers provide an intimate environment where you can chat, share memories, coordinate activities, and maintain relationships with people you know personally. The smaller scale makes them ideal for casual conversations and personal connections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT970XC7203923YRMKY4\">Community Servers</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community servers</a></strong> are larger, invite-only spaces designed to bring together people from around the world who share common interests, hobbies, or goals. These servers focus on fostering learning, discussion, and connection within specific communities—whether that's gaming, art, technology, or countless other topics.</p>\n<p>Community servers come with enhanced moderation tools to help manage larger groups effectively, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032807371-Server-Insights-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Insights</a>: Analytics to understand your community's activity, growth patterns, and member engagement</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10989121220631-How-to-Protect-Your-Server-from-Raids-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raid Protection</a>: Advanced security features to protect against spam, bot attacks, and disruptive behavior</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rules</a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onboarding</a>: Structured systems to welcome new members, establish community guidelines, and create screening processes</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591-Community-Server-Welcome-Screen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Welcome Screen</a>: Customizable introduction for new members</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Discovery</a>: Ability to be found in Discord's server discovery feature (if eligible)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tools make Community servers well-suited for building thriving, organized communities that can scale while maintaining a positive environment for all members.</p>\n<div class=\"book-box\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Want to learn more?</strong></span>\n<p id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BP8PBTQ3YKA0476J2\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">For a deeper dive into server types and their specific features, check out our comprehensive </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14078261239831-Clarifying-Server-Types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clarifying Server Types article</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">, which covers additional details and best practices for choosing the right server type for your community.</span></p>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BFSEDK3NH6EJ1ADQK\">Getting Started with Discord Servers</h1>\n<p>Creating your first Discord server is a simple process that takes just a few minutes.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span></div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYM0S2ZJPD6M2M6QY10JXNW1\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed.

However, you cannot downgrade subscriptions - you'll need to wait until your current subscription ends to switch to a lower tier. </p>\n<p>Please note that if you upgrade or cancel your Nitro Classic subscription, you will not be able to re-subscribe to Classic.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to use the same payment method for upgrades as my subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>A: For security and billing consistency, your payment method for upgrades must match the one used for your recurring subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I use a different payment method for my upgrade?</strong></p>\n<p>A: To use a different payment method:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First change your subscription's payment method</li>\n<li>Then proceed with the upgrade</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note: The payment method you choose for the upgrade will become your new default payment method for future subscription payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will upgrading change my billing date?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, upgrading your subscription will not change your billing date. Your next payment will still occur on the same day.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I upgrade from a monthly to yearly subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>A: When upgrading from monthly to yearly, you'll be charged for the yearly plan minus the prorated credit from your remaining monthly subscription time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will I lose my current benefits when upgrading?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you'll keep all your current benefits plus gain additional features from the upgraded tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I upgrade from a monthly to an annual plan?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, you can change your billing cycle when upgrading. Nitro annual plans offer a better value for your Discord experience!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What payment methods are accepted?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Discord accepts credit/debit cards, PayPal, and various regional payment methods based on your location.

Why?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you don't see any promotion details on your Nitro tab on the desktop or browser (this promotion is not available on the iOS on mobile), it is because you do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I upgrade my subscription from Nitro Basic or Nitro Classic to Nitro, can I receive this promotion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, this promotion applies for upgrades from Nitro Basic or Classic to Nitro.</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>How much will I be charged if I upgrade my plan to Nitro?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We prorate the amount you'll be charged for upgrading to Nitro, which depends on:<br>1. Whether you're upgrading from Basic or Classic<br>2. The amount of your existing subscription plan you haven’t used<br>3. The remaining amount of your new subscription plan you will use after upgrading</p>\n<p>For example, if you've used Nitro Basic for only 10 days this month, you'll only be charged for those 10 days at Basic's price. Then, if you upgrade to Nitro mid-month and have 20 days left, you'll only pay for those 20 days at Nitro's price, rather than for the entire month.</p>\n<p>You can find more details <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017693772-Payments-and-Billing-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I claimed and redeemed a different trial for Discord Nitro already. Can I access this promo?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Unfortunately, if you are currently on a free trial, discounted plan or have been in the last 10 days before attempting to claim, you are not eligible for this promotion. Have no fear, there will be more of these promotions down the road! </p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I have Nitro credit in my account, can I apply it to this promo?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you have credit in your account from a previous Nitro subscription, this credit will be automatically applied to the purchase total when you check out.</p>\n<p>If you have credit in your account that is associated with a different Nitro subscription type (ex: Nitro Classic), it will not apply to this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I'm currently using Nitro credit and claim this promotional offer? </strong></p>\n<p>A: On desktop, Nitro credit users can purchase and claim this promotion. Here's how it works:</p>\n<p>When you claim the offer while on Nitro credit, your paid subscription will begin immediately. Any remaining Nitro credit will be applied after your first paid month ends, followed by your extra free month, and then your regular subscription will continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have 4 days of Nitro credit remaining when you claim the offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your first paid month starts immediately</li>\n<li>After 30 days, your remaining 4 days of Nitro credit activates</li>\n<li>Once those 4 days end, your extra free month begins</li>\n<li>After that, your regular monthly subscription resumes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This ensures you get the full value of both your Nitro credit and the promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a notification saying \"You're ineligible for this offer\". Why?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you encounter this notification, it is because you do not meet the eligibility criteria outlined above.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will my subscription renew automatically after the promotion ends?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes your subscription will renew automatically after the promotion ends. If you’d like to make changes to your subscription, including cancel, you can find more information <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/19580873036695-How-to-Cancel-your-Nitro-Server-Boosting-or-other-Discord-Subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I gift my month of Nitro to someone else?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, this month of Nitro is yours to keep and will be automatically applied to your account. It can’t be gifted or transferred to another user.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I purchased a Nitro subscription during the promotion period, but I’d like to request a refund. What are the steps?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Before requesting a refund, please review our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071-Refund-Policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Refund Policy</a> to ensure that your purchase is eligible for a refund.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to proceed, please send in a ticket specifying that you’d like a refund for your Nitro purchase to our support team here: <a href=\"http://dis.gd/billing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dis.gd/billing</a> and our agents will be happy to assist you.</p>\n<p>Please note that if your refund is issued, you will lose any promotional value or discounts associated with the purchase.</p>"

(“Media Company”) and the advertiser designated on an IO (“Advertiser”), or, if applicable, Advertiser’s agency designated on an IO (“Agency”).  The terms of this Discord Addendum will control over and fully supersede any similar, conflicting, inconsistent or overlapping terms in the IAB Terms or other parts of an IO; however, if an IO expressly states that certain terms set forth in the IO are intended to supersede the terms of this Discord Addendum, then, in the event of conflict, those terms of the applicable IO will control only for that IO and only to the extent of such conflict. Any purchase order terms, “clickthrough” or other online agreements, or other similar documents made available to Media Company by Advertiser or Agency are hereby rejected by Media Company and will not apply to any Quest. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings given to such terms in the IAB Terms. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Where Advertiser is purchasing directly from Media Company, (i) Section 2 and any references to Agency herein will be deemed deleted and will not apply; and (ii) all references in the IAB Terms to Agency, will be deemed to be references to Advertiser.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">1.

Media Company will implement a promotional campaign on its platform (the “Discord Platform”) for Advertiser’s applicable property designated on an IO (the “Advertiser Property”) where eligible users of the Discord Platform will be able to complete certain agreed-upon tasks relating to the Advertiser Property and earn certain agreed-upon rewards (“Rewards”), as further detailed in an applicable IO (each such campaign, a “Quest”).  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">b. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Quest T&amp;Cs</span><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">. Media Company will, in consultation with Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, establish the specific terms and requirements for users governing each Quest (“Quest T&amp;Cs”), and will publish the Quest T&amp;Cs to users in connection with such Quest. The Quest T&amp;Cs will address, at a minimum (i) user eligibility requirements and any criteria and tasks that must be satisfied by a user in order to receive a Reward; (ii) the nature of the applicable Reward, including whether the Reward will be supplied by Media Company (each, a “Media Company Reward”) or Advertiser (each, an “Advertiser Reward”); and (iv) any other terms, conditions and limitations pertaining to the redemption and use of the Reward.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">c. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Advertiser Rewards</span><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">.

For any Quest with an Advertiser Reward: (i) reasonably in advance of the applicable flight dates for a Quest, the parties will agree in writing (email to suffice) on and implement the fulfillment and redemption mechanics for the Advertiser Reward, which may consist of the delivery to Media Company of a sufficient number of redemption codes for users to redeem for Advertiser Rewards; (ii) Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will ensure that the Advertiser Reward and the redemption process is consistent with the Quest T&amp;Cs; and (iii) in the event of any fulfillment or redemption issues (including, without limitation, insufficient or defective redemption codes) in connection with a Quest, Media Company may suspend such Quest until such issues are resolved.  For clarity, Advertiser is solely responsible for the Advertiser Rewards and any associated fraud, losses, or other issues in connection with such Advertiser Rewards. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">d. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Media Company Rewards</span><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">.  For any Quest where the applicable IO indicates there will be a Media Company Reward, Media Company will (i) ensure that such Media Company Reward and redemption process is consistent with the Quest T&amp;Cs; and (ii) will have responsibility (unless otherwise agreed in the IO) and control over the design and creation of such Media Company Reward. Media Company will obtain Advertiser’s or Agency’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) for any Media Company Reward that contains or is derived from Advertising Materials. Media Company Rewards may not be available to users in certain regions where not supported by the Discord Platform. Advertiser and Agency may not terminate for convenience any Quest with (i) a Media Company Reward that contains or is derived from Advertising Materials or (ii) any other custom Media Company Reward created specifically for the Quest. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">e. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Advertiser Marks License</span><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">i.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Info:</span></strong><span style=\"color: #434343;\"> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span>\n</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JV392VD5N2AE5ZE46HSSNM4T\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I didn't receive an email from Epic Games Store with the Nitro promo link, even if I have an Epic Games Store account?</strong></p>\n<p>A: In order to receive an email from Epic Games Store with the Nitro promo link, you must have an Epic Games Store account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, make sure that you've opted to receive marketing emails from the Epic Games Store.

These exemptions vary by state, country and jurisdiction.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JM35B0EPY92AXCQHKW\">Required Documentation</h1>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Info</strong>: It is your responsibility to submit all required information for a tax exemption before making any qualifying purchases. Submitting a tax exemption request does not guarantee you will receive this exemption. Discord will review your documents and relevant tax authority records to determine whether an exemption should be applied.</span></div>\n<p>To help you submit the correct documentation for your tax exemption request, review the section below that applies to your situation:</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMXSP2XZH7PWK0QZGJ\">VAT Exemptions </h2>\n<p>If you're requesting a VAT exemption, you'll need to provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your valid VAT ID number - this must be active and verifiable</li>\n<li>Your country of registration</li>\n<li>Complete invoice details including your registered business name and address</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMV9S7DK4SBGDZ3YEE\">US Tax Exemptions</h2>\n<p>For organizations based in the United States, please provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your sales tax exemption certificate with all required fields completed. Forms will vary by state, so please be sure to provide us with the form applicable to your state.</li>\n<li>Your state code - this is required for proper processing</li>\n<li>Complete invoice information matching your tax-exempt organization</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JM4EXTVEVRM47HJEQZ\">Other Tax Exemptions</h2>\n<p>For all other types of tax exemptions, you'll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A valid Tax ID number from your local tax authority</li>\n<li>Your country of registration</li>\n<li>Complete invoice details that match your registration</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Info</span></strong><span style=\"color: #434343;\">: We verify the documentation for accuracy and validity. If necessary, we may contact the issuing state’s or country’s tax authority to confirm legitimacy.</span>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JM4WKV0209PE0V34XC\">How to Validate Tax Exemption</h1>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Info</strong>: Tax exemptions apply only from the date of approval onward—previous purchases cannot be adjusted. Once validated, the exemption automatically applies to all future purchases.</span></div>\n<p>To help you get your tax exemption approved quickly, here's what we look for when reviewing your request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Valid ID Check</strong>: We'll verify your VAT/Tax ID with the official tax authorities to ensure it's current and valid.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Regional Verification</strong>: Your tax exemption must be applicable in your specific country or region.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Matching Addresses</strong>: For your security, your payment method's billing address needs to match the country where your tax exemption is registered.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation Review</strong>: We'll check that all your invoice details align with our verification records.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Final Review</strong>: Our Support team will carefully review your application to ensure everything is in order.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Info</strong>: Having all these items ready before submission can help speed up the approval process.</span></div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMFBKRE9FEAY18FW8E\">What Happens After Submission?</h1>\n<p>Once you submit your tax exemption request, our dedicated Support team will carefully review your application. Here's what you can expect:</p>\n<p id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMVAAS6X80G25WJQ1E\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\"><strong>If Your Request is Approved:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our Support team will process your exemption within 5-7 business days</li>\n<li>You'll receive a confirmation email with your exemption details</li>\n<li>All future purchases will automatically be tax-exempt</li>\n<li>We may periodically verify that your tax exemption is still valid</li>\n<li>You can view your tax-exempt status in your account settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"h_01JTNWS5JNHE7V2Y7NHN0E49F5\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\"><strong>If Your Request Needs Additional Information:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our team will reach out via email with specific instructions</li>\n<li>You'll have 30 days to provide the requested documentation</li>\n<li>Your application will remain pending during this time</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"h_01JTNWS5JNTSAWWD2V66ZSAEQ1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\"><strong>If Your Request is Not Approved:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You'll receive an email explaining why your request wasn't approved</li>\n<li>Your purchases will continue to include applicable taxes</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"form-box\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Contact Us</strong>: Our </span><a href=\"http://dis.gd/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support team</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\"> is always here to assist you with any questions about your tax exemption status.</span>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JNPGFQJY9D0F3RHNK6\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: How long does the tax exemption approval process take?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The standard processing time is 5-7 business days after submission of a complete application with all required documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I get a refund for taxes paid before my exemption was approved?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, tax exemptions only apply to future purchases from the date of approval. Previous purchases cannot be adjusted retroactively.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if my tax ID or status changes?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You must notify our Support team immediately of any changes to your tax status or ID. This may require submitting a new application with updated documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use my tax exemption for multiple Discord accounts?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Each tax exemption is tied to a specific account and billing address. Separate applications are required for different accounts or organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I need to update my business information?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Contact our support team with any changes to your business details. Some updates may require new documentation or re-verification of your tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I know if my organization qualifies for tax exemption?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Qualification depends on your organization's legal status and local tax regulations. We recommend consulting with your tax advisor or reviewing your local tax authority guidelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I get a tax exemption for purchases I made through Apple and/or Google Play?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>We cannot assist with tax exemption requests for purchases made through Apple or Google Play.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span></div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYKZ6ZT086RQRZ1R08DRT6A3\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed.

Different servers can use the same tag, though the combination of the tag and icon will help distinguish your community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens to members' profiles if our server loses the Server Tag perk?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If your server loses the Server Tag perk due to insufficient boosts, the tag will no longer be available for members to wear on their profile. Any members who had the tag applied will have it automatically removed from their profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I change our Server Tag after it's been created?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, server owners and admins can change the Server Tag at any time. However, when you update a Server Tag, members will need to manually reapply the new tag to their profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can server members customize the color of the Server Tag on their profile?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, the color of the Server Tag is set by the server owner/admin and remains consistent for all members who use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How many Server Tags can a user display on their profile at once?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Users can display only one Server Tag on their profile at a time, even if they belong to multiple servers with tags.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I restrict which members can use our Server Tag?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Currently, there's no way to restrict which members can use the Server Tag. Any member of your server can choose to display it on their profile.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do Server Tags appear in messages or just on profiles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Server Tags that are applied to a user’s profile will appear next to their name everywhere on Discord. This includes in chat, member lists, and Direct Messages lists.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I include emoji or special characters in a Server Tag?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Server Tags can consist of alphanumerical characters and certain special characters. Certain characters, spaces, and emojis are not supported at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can my server have multiple Server Tags?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, each server can only have one Server Tag at a time. If you want to change your server's tag, you'll need to update the existing one rather than creating additional tags. Remember that when you update your Server Tag, members will need to reapply the new tag to their profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will other users be able to click on my Server Tag to join the server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, selecting a Server Tag will open the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/30715364399511-Server-Profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Profile</a> for that server. If applications are enabled, they can apply to join the server from the server profile. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use current Server Boosts on my server for Server Tags?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are a server admin or owner and you have 3 Server Boosts already available for your server to use, then you can enable Server Tags right away. If you don't have enough Server Boosts available, you may need to change your current Server Level or get more Boosts from your community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I edit or change my current Server Tag in my server? </strong></p>\n<p>A: If you update the Server Tag for your server, server members will have to reapply the tag again for the change to take effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there a rate limit for how many times I can change my server tag once it is set?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, there is a rate limit for changing your server tag. You can change your server tag after a certain period of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are “additional perks” and how are they different from Levels?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Additional perks are new features you can unlock directly with Boosts, separate from your server's Boost Level. Currently, there are two available: Enhanced Role Styles (which add gradient and holographic effects to roles) and Server Tags (4-character identifiers members can display on their profiles across Discord). Unlike traditional server levels, these perks can be unlocked individually without reaching specific level thresholds.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How much do the new Additional Perks cost?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Enhanced Role Styles and Server Tags each cost 3 Boosts. If you want both perks, you'll need 6 Boosts total (3 for each perk).</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are Additional Perks replacing the current server level system?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, this supplements the existing level system. All current server level perks (emoji slots, file upload limits, etc.) remain exactly the same. This new system simply gives you additional ways to use your Boosts for targeted perks without affecting your server's level progression.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do Additional Perks use separate Boosts from my server level?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, Boosts used for Additional Perks are dedicated specifically to those perks and don't count toward your server's level progression. Similarly, Boosts allocated to your server level can't be used for Additional Perks. You'll need separate Boosts for each - so if you want Enhanced Role Styles, you need 3 Boosts just for that perk, plus whatever Boosts you want to maintain your current server level.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens to my Additional Perks if my server loses Boosts?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Perks require ongoing Boost allocation to remain active. If your server drops below the required number of Boosts for a perk, that perk will be disabled. Enhanced Role Styles will revert to solid colors, and Server Tags will be removed from members' profiles. Server owners/admins can choose which perks to maintain if Boost counts drop.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why can't I unlock perks even though I have enough Boosts?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Make sure you're accessing the Server Boost tab (visible only to server owners/admins) and that your Boosts are \"available\" rather than already allocated to your server level. Only server members with admin permissions can unlock Additional Perks. You need to have enough unallocated Boosts to enable Additional Perks. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I move Boosts between levels and perks after I've allocated them?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, server owners and admins can reallocate Boosts between server levels and Additional Perks through the Server Boosts tab. However, if you move Boosts away from a perk, that perk will be disabled until you allocate enough Boosts back to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Are Additional Perks a one-time purchase, or do they require ongoing Boosts?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Each additional perk requires an ongoing allocation of its required Boosts to stay active, just like levels. If your server drops below the required number of Boosts, the perk will be disabled until the necessary Boosts are reallocated.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I purchase and manage Additional Perks from both desktop and mobile?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Additional Perks can currently only be purchased and configured on desktop.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Once you've unlocked Enhanced Role Styles by applying 3 Server Boosts, you can apply gradient or holographic styles to as many roles as you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do Enhanced Role Styles appear on mobile devices?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Enhanced Role Styles are fully supported on all Discord platforms, including mobile. Members will see gradient and holographic roles on iOS and Android just as they appear on desktop/browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I combine Enhanced Role Styles with other role features like role icons?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Absolutely! Enhanced Role Styles work alongside all other role features, including role icons, so you can create truly distinctive roles for your community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I switch from gradient to holographic (or vice versa), will I need to spend additional boosts?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. Once Enhanced Role Styles are unlocked for your server, you can freely switch between gradient and holographic styles for any role without using additional boosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do members need to have a specific Discord version to see Enhanced Role Styles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Members will need a reasonably current version of Discord to see Enhanced Role Styles. Anyone using an outdated app version may only see the solid color version of the roles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do Enhanced Role Styles appear in dark mode vs. light mode?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Enhanced Role Styles are designed to look great in both dark and light mode, with automatic adjustments to ensure visibility and aesthetic appeal in either theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I disable the animation effect for Enhanced Role Styles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Select the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31809886435863\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">] next to your Discord username to access your <strong>User Settings</strong>, select the <strong>Accessibility</strong> tab, and then enable <strong>Enabled Reduced Motion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I add Enhanced Role Styles to a server I'm a member of?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're a server member who wants to enable Enhanced Role Styles for your server, you can Boost your server to ensure there are enough Boosts available for a perk like this. However, only server admins &amp; owners can enable this perk and configure it for their server.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31809877381271\" width=\"575\" height=\"444\"></strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JT6WD7SHK6QQG5FN079A52WB\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Enable Reduced Motion setting</h4>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I use the current Server Boosts on my server for Server Tags instead?</strong></p>\n<p>A: As a server owner or admin, you can disable the currently applied boosts to a level.

Select “<strong>Grant Access</strong>”</li>\n<li>Without this permission, your stream will continue but viewers won't be able to hear any audio from your streaming application</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JQCD37F205C5BZET4KP4PP0T\"><strong>Noise Canceller Error (1002)</strong></h2>\n<p>If Discord encounters an internal error with its background noise canceller:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave the voice channel or call and then rejoin to reset the connection</li>\n<li>If the issue persists, try completely restarting Discord\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Note</strong>: This means fully closing the application (not just minimizing it) and relaunching it!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JQCD37F2Y80YWEQQVFJCEBZD\"><strong>Audio Input Rate Mismatch (1003)</strong></h2>\n<p>This error occurs when Discord detects a significant difference in microphone input rate, often resulting in distorted audio (like \"robot voice\" or slow speech).</p>\n<p>To resolve this issue, try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using separate devices for audio input and output (e.g., USB microphone + separate headphones)</li>\n<li>Switching to a different microphone if available</li>\n<li>Changing your audio output device</li>\n<li>Leaving and rejoining the voice channel</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">This issue is most common with combined input/output devices like gaming headsets.
