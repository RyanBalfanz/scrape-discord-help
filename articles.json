This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

This filter can help you reduce exposure to offensive or unwanted language, giving you a more comfortable experience on Discord. It works by redacting detected keywords with asterisks (****) from a pre-selected library of words. </p>\n<p>The filter is opt-in, and allows you to turn it on and off whenever you’d like. This filter only runs on your Discord client locally, meaning, this automatic filtering does not happen on Discord servers and Discord does not read your messages to power this filter. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J1QCP3DHMW0H5RBHW63GF6VP\">How to Enable/Disable the Language Filter</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1QCP3DHCGKAW56ZM44FHH5W\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">This feature is available on desktop, browser, and mobile.</span></h3>\n<p>1.

The filter works directly on your device, so your messages stay private and are not sent to Discord’s servers for filtering.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What types of keywords are filtered?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The filter uses the same keyword list as<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/auto-moderation-in-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Automod</a>, which filters words from a preset list selected by Discord of commonly flagged words in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Insults and Slurs</strong>: Personally insulting material, including terms that may be considered slurs or hate speech.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sensitive Content</strong>: Sexually explicit language.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severe Profanity</strong>: Egregious forms of profanity, while still allowing for mild forms of cursing or swearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I add my own keywords to this list?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, the filter is not customizable.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I turn off or disable the language filter?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, the filter is opt-in and can be enabled or disabled in the <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> tab in your  <strong>User Settings </strong>at any time. This setting is disabled by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I view the blocked word in the message without having to turn the filter off?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you will have to disable the filter to view blocked words.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will we support other languages besides English?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We’ll explore options for supporting other languages in future versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where will the filter work?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The filter works in DMs, GDMs (group messages), or in servers where server moderators have not enabled<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/auto-moderation-in-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Automod</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will the language filter apply to all devices I use Discord on?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, the filter setting will apply across all devices you use Discord on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What should I do if I find a word that should be filtered, but isn’t?</strong></p>\n<p>A: There is no way to provide feedback on specific requests, but we’ll continue to evolve the keyword list overtime.</p>"

If you are in a server where you want an app removed but don't have permissions, please reach out to the server admin or leave the server.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where can I use Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>A: <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2580c40c-7fff-dbfd-6cde-4a9d79bdf6a2\">Apps that are added directly to a server can be used within that server if the server’s permissions are set up to allow members to use that app. Apps that are added directly to a user’s account can be used in any server that the user is in.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I install an app to my account?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Some apps can be installed to your account directly, instead of a server. Some developers will be updating their apps to enable this functionality. If you see an app that has this feature enabled, feel free to add the app to your account! Please note that apps that are added to your account may not have all the same capabilities as apps added to a server. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-c39d8fa9-7fff-bec8-aff4-b6e0f6352beb\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: My server utilizes AutoMod. Will messages from application commands be affected or flagged by AutoMod?</strong></p>\n<p>A: AutoMod will not flag messages from apps that you’ve installed onto your server.</p>\n<p>AutoMod will only flag messages from apps that are installed directly onto a user’s account. Any actions taken by AutoMod will happen on the user who installed the application and first used it in a server. This means if an application creates a message with buttons, additional messages created from interacting with those buttons will also action against the user who used the command initially.</p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-e85834a2-7fff-0283-d839-1b1aa05d5e5b\"><strong>Q: What data can an app access about me or my server or DM, or the people in it?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Apps you’ve added to your account can access your information that you've authorized. These apps are not able to access information about your server or DMs. They also do not have permissions to take action in your server or DMs, other than responding to your interactions. Additionally, user installed apps are not able to get information about members of your servers or DMs that have not used the app. If a user does choose to interact with the app (e.g., through buttons and select menus), then the app can access their basic user information, like their username, user ID, avatar, and (if in a server) your server nickname, roles, and permissions. </p>\n<p>Apps added to servers can access data as generally described <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7933951485975-Visibility-of-Bot-Data-Access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about a specific app's data practices, please refer to the app’s developer or its privacy policy.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>"

Any time someone sends a message, Discord shows a little white dot next to the channel and server to let you know a new message has been sent.</p>\n<p>It can be information overload, and so naturally you take the only action you can and mute the server. Problem solved, right?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it becomes harder to pay attention to the 1 or 2 channels you really like on that specific server. You start missing out on moments because it’s muted. You have to try to remember to go back to that server and check those specific channels. But what if you forget? </p>\n<p>If this sounds familiar, we have good news! Discord is introducing a “middle ground” setting between “show me everything” and “show me nothing”. Let’s go over this setting a little bit more.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2NDX2BVBJT724Y9TC\">How to setup the new notification feature</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T25RJ9DM6RFVHDESSQ\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">This experiment is available on both the desktop and mobile app, however, the below modal will only pop-up in the desktop app.</span></h3>\n<p>If this experimental feature becomes available to you, Discord will help you get started by showing this modal the next time you launch Discord.</p>\n<p>Just follow the prompts and select which servers have the most important updates for you!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266097815\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></p>\n<p>It will also help explain what has changed and give you a chance to pick and choose some servers that you want to try this feature out on right away. </p>\n<p>We recommend trying it on servers that might overwhelm you, but have channels you’re interested in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2YFE1F7MYV75QA4HV\">Notification Settings</h2>\n<p>Let’s go over how this feature affects each type of notification setting and then how to set a Custom setting on both desktop and mobile.</p>\n<p><strong>All Messages</strong>: When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>All Messages</strong>, everything will behave exactly like before: The channel is highlighted in white, and both the channel and server show a little white dot next to them.</p>\n<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message in the channel.</p>\n<p><strong>@Mentions</strong> (a.k.a. Only Mentions): When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>@Mentions</strong>, the channel is not highlighted. Instead the channel stays the same color, and shows a light gray dot next to it. It gives you a hint of activity, but doesn’t try to compel you to check in on the channel. </p>\n<p>Most importantly the server does not show a white or gray dot at all! This allows you to check these channels on your own schedule, instead of being nagged to check them right away.</p>\n<p>If someone mentions you in this channel though, the channel will be highlighted in white, and both the server and channel will have a red badge so you know something important happened.</p>\n<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message that mentions you in the channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Nothing: </strong>When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to “Nothing”, the channel and server will behave the same way as @Mentions, however you will never receive a notification from this channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>\n<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>\n<p>2. Right-click on the channel and then navigate to <strong>Notifications</strong> and then tap on <strong>Custom.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266099479\" width=\"395\" height=\"407\"></strong></p>\n<p>If you select the <strong>Custom</strong> option, this allows you to change each behavior independently, such as how should Discord display that there are new messages and when should Discord notify you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile</strong></p>\n<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>\n<p>2. Long press on the channel you want to adjust the settings for then tap on <strong>Notification Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>3. Here you can customize your notification settings for this channel.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084281584535\" width=\"365\" height=\"614\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T29T3D3A3ZQP39WCE5\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\">To learn more about notifications, please check out our </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Notifications Settings 101</span></a><span style=\"color: #434343;\"> article.</span>\n</h3>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T27Q8S6MSRZ5P53J2H\">When should I use this specific notification setting?</h1>\n<p>This setting is best for larger, busy servers and channels where you may prefer to check them on your own schedule. Instead of muting them, now you can pick and choose the channels you care about most, without being notified to visit the other channels. It’s like a better way of muting! This setting allows you to ignore everything by default while picking the specific channels you care about in a server.</p>\n<p>For example: Do you want to know when there’s a new update to a game you play or an update to an app you use? You can set that server to <strong>Mentions Only</strong>, and then  select the channel with release announcements to <strong>All Messages</strong>! Now you’ll get notified about that one channel, without getting overwhelmed by the rest of the server.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2EA493Y2Y4HFXZPNP\">How do I turn this feature off?</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2F8Y8CZKACQJT1YDF\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">The option to disable this feature is only on the desktop app.</span></h3>\n<p>If you do not want to use this feature, here is how to disable it.</p>\n<p>1. Tap on the cogwheel [<img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084281586071\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">] in the bottom left corner of the desktop app to open up your <strong>User Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>2. Then scroll down until you see <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p>\n<p>3. Now tap on the <strong>check mark</strong> next to <strong>New Unread Settings (experimental)</strong> to toggle it to an <strong>x</strong> to turn it off. Your notification settings will be fully restored to a backup created earlier.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266103575\" width=\"624\" height=\"437\"></strong></p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this feature, please reach out to our <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Support team</span></a>.</p>\n<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>"

Then tap on <strong>Voice </strong>and enter a name for the new channel.</p>\n<p>3. Tap on <strong>Create Channel</strong> when you’re ready to create the channel.</p>\n<p>4. Congratulations! You now have a new voice channel in your server.

Tap on <strong>Create Channel</strong> when you’re ready to create the channel.</p>\n<p>4. Congratulations! You now have a new voice channel in your server.

Where can I find this missing gift?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you bought a gift from the Shop but it was not sent to your friend, you can go to <strong>User Settings &gt; Gift Inventory</strong> where you’ll find any purchased but unsent gifts. You can resend those gifts from the <strong>Gift Inventory</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens to my purchased items if my account is deleted?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your use of Discord is subject to our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terms of Service</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community Guidelines</a>, and access to any items purchased on Discord may be lost in the case of temporary or permanent account suspension or self-requested deletion. Additionally, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. </p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-5bb8c24f-7fff-9a25-c5f5-2f21c75d8c35\"><strong>Q: What if my friend sends me a gift from the Shop, but I already have the item in my collection? </strong></p>\n<p>A: Don’t worry, your friend will not be able to send an item that has already been claimed and added to your collection. </p>\n<p>However, if a gifted item has not been claimed and added to your collection, it is possible that you may receive the same gifted item again. If this is the case, you can choose to claim one of the gifts. Then, the other gifts with the same item will be returned to the sender within 48 hours, and they can choose to send the gift to someone else.</p>"

The arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 10 do not apply to (i) any dispute alleging infringement of Intellectual Property Rights; (ii) the issue of regarding whether a Claim must be arbitrated; or (iii) the seeking of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief to maintain the status quo while the arbitration of the substantive issues is pending.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #222222;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">11.
