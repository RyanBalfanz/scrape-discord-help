How do I see it?</strong></p><p>A: To view your Wishlist, open your full Discord profile by selecting your <strong>avatar</strong> in the bottom-left corner, then selecting your <strong>avatar</strong> again. Once your profile opens, select the <strong>Wishlist</strong> tab to see all your saved items.</p><p><strong>Q: How many items can I add to my Wishlist?</strong></p><p>A: Currently, there's no set limit to the number of items you can add to your Wishlist. Add as many favorites as you'd like!</p><p><strong>Q: Can I reorder items on my Wishlist?</strong></p><p>A: Items appear on your Wishlist in the order you added them, with the most recent additions showing first. You can't manually reorder items, but you can remove and re-add items to change their position.</p><p><strong>Q: What types of items can I add to my Wishlist?</strong></p><p>A: You can add most Shop items including avatar decorations, profile effects, and themes. However, items you already own, Orb-exclusive items, and bundles cannot be added to your Wishlist.</p><p><strong>Q: Is Wishlist available on mobile?</strong></p><p>A: Wishlist is currently available on desktop and browser only. We're testing the feature before expanding to mobile platforms.</p><p><strong>Q: Can friends see when I add items to my Wishlist?</strong></p><p>A: No, adding items to your Wishlist is private. Friends can see your Wishlist when they visit your profile (if it's set to public), but they won't receive notifications when you add new items.</p><p><strong>Q: What happens to my Wishlist items if I receive them as a gift?</strong></p><p>A: When someone gifts you an item from your Wishlist, it's automatically removed from your Wishlist since you now own it. This helps keep your Wishlist up to date!</p><p><strong>Q: Will I know if someone views my Wishlist?</strong></p><p>A: No, there's no notification when someone views your Wishlist. Friends can browse your Wishlist privately to find the perfect gift for you.</p><p><strong>Q: If I make my Wishlist private, can I still add items to it?</strong></p><p>A: Yes! You can continue adding and managing items on your Wishlist even when it's set to private. Only the visibility to others changes.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I hide specific items on my Wishlist while keeping it public?</strong></p><p>A: No, Wishlist privacy is all-or-nothing. If your Wishlist is public, all items on it are visible. If you want to keep certain items private, you'll need to remove them or set your entire Wishlist to private.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I gift someone an item that's not on their Wishlist?</strong></p><p>A: Yes! You can <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17162747936663-Shop-FAQ#h_01J4T4Z6G3GCXP9S76GKGBR98G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">gift any Shop item</span></a> to friends, not just items from their Wishlist. The Wishlist simply makes it easier to know what they'd love to receive.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I accidentally send a gift to the wrong person?</strong></p><p>A: Shop gift purchases are final and cannot be refunded or transferred. Double-check the recipient before completing your purchase. Please visit our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071-Refund-Policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Refund Policy</span></a> for more information.</p><p><strong>Q: Can someone regift an item I sent them?</strong></p><p>A: No, items cannot be regifted.

Without Discord's standard safety features, you should take extra precautions to protect yourself in these external spaces.</p><p><strong>Before You Join:</strong> Avoid joining servers hosted by people you don’t know and trust in real life or from well-known groups you trust. Be selective—these servers may have different safety features from those you’re used to on Discord, so your choice of which servers to join becomes your primary safety measure.</p><p><strong>Protect Your Privacy:</strong> Refrain from sharing personal information like your real name, location, age, school, or contact details on game servers. Be especially cautious of anyone who tries to move conversations to other platforms, offers unexpected gifts or special treatment, or asks you to keep interactions secret. These are red flags for potentially harmful behavior that can escalate quickly in unmoderated spaces.</p><p><strong>Use Available Safety Tools:</strong> Consider enabling any safety features the server offers like chat filters, allowlist controls, and moderation plugins. When creating your own server, use allowlist controls to limit access to known friends, enable moderation tools, and establish clear behavioral expectations from the start. Remember that these tools may differ from what you're used to with Discord's built-in protections.</p><p><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If someone makes you uncomfortable, leave immediately. Your safety is more important than game progress, maintaining friendships, or avoiding awkwardness. It's never your fault if someone acts inappropriately toward you. Report concerning behavior <em>happening in the game server</em> to the server admin if you trust them, or use the game host's reporting system (like <a href=\"https://shockbyte.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Shockbyte's support form</span></a>). If you see behavior that violates our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Terms of Service</span></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Community Guidelines</span></a> <em>happening on Discord</em>, please <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">report it directly to us</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> These servers exist outside Discord's safety ecosystem, meaning the automatic detection systems and rapid response teams you might expect aren't available. Maintain strong boundaries, be skeptical of unusual requests, and prioritize your wellbeing over gameplay.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K7Q3AJERHPMXVXGTSMN52DZK\">How to Join a Game Server</h2><p>Once created, game servers will appear in the new Game Servers tab at the top of your server.

Boosts used to level up your server <strong>do not</strong> count toward unlocking Game Servers. To enable Game Servers, you’ll need to apply Boosts <strong>specifically</strong> toward creating a game server. Once a game server is created, the Game Servers tab will appear in your server.</p><p><strong>Q: How many Boosts does it cost to create a Game Server?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> The number of Boosts required depends on the <strong>game and plan</strong> you choose. The least expensive option starts at <strong>3 Boosts</strong>, with certain games and higher-tier plans requiring more. All Boosts allocated go directly toward that game server, there’s <strong>no extra Boost cost</strong> just to unlock the feature.</p><p><strong>Q: How many Game Servers can be created in one Discord server?</strong></p><p>A: You can have a maximum of 10 Game Servers per Discord server.</p><p><strong>Q: What does the current game server’s status mean? </strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/35684686208919\" width=\"624\" height=\"324\"></strong></p><h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" id=\"h_01K7Q3ATDXXJ8WMYKQPFQ2NW7S\">\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\">Server Status of a Game Server</span> </h4><p>A: Depending on the state of the server, you may see a variety of different Server Statuses.

You can learn more at this <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4708041338391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Help Center article.</span></a></p><p><strong>Q: What if I'm a current or previous Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or a Server Boost subscription? Can I also take part in this promotion? </strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>If you previously had a Discord Nitro subscription at any point on your accounts and have had a Nitro Classic or Nitro Basic subscription in the past 12 months, you are ineligible to redeem this promotion.</p><p>If you have had a Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting subscription active on your account and you’ve never had a Nitro subscription, you will be able to redeem this promotion and replace it with the Nitro subscription.</p><div class=\"warn-box\">HOWEVER, please note: By choosing to activate this trial, you will lose any features associated with your current subscriptions, and **you will not receive a refund for any remaining value on your current subscription**.</div><p>At the end of the promotion period, you'll be converted to a paying Nitro subscription per month unless you cancel your subscription.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K3W2ZXGR2KY6DPJQV0AV3F98\">Payment Info and Subscription Questions</h2><p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your  trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p><p>However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time before the end of the trial.</p><p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K3W2ZXGTPFWERPKYPWY0GBJQ\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro subscription so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p><p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this perk.</p><p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p><p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a \"This gift has been claimed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p><p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p><p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if you are given an invalid promo and we will not be able to provide a new promo.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error when I click on “Next”.</strong></p><p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p><ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ef94a71783540cbf4777549deceffcb2c\">You are ineligible for this promotion</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec18ff79ab554ccd8188a316f21b3f119\">The promotion is invalid</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec1767da0234072d31fa8a5e91fd37b25\">The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e42dbb8c1356674f49cb417d5eab04174\">The link is invalid</li>\n</ul><p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem. See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p><p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p><p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">this article</span></a>!</p><p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p><p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p><p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p><p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><div class=\"info-box\">Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K20JEN2SYZAXMAFSMH89160J\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

Think of servers as virtual meeting places that bring people together around shared interests, hobbies, or relationships. Each server is organized with different channels dedicated to specific purposes—whether that's text conversations, voice chats, or media sharing—making it easy to keep discussions organized and accessible.</p>\n<p>Discord servers are free to create and can accommodate anywhere from a small group of friends to massive communities with thousands of members. They offer flexibility in organization, moderation tools, and customization options that make them suitable for virtually any type of group or community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96AZHQ9EJVPG49MNJ2\">Understanding Different Types of Servers</h1>\n<p>Discord offers two main server types, each designed for different community needs and scales:</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96THW43XKZDGD1FRBX\">Friend Servers</h2>\n<p><strong>Friend servers</strong> are private, invite-only spaces perfect for staying connected with your close friends or smaller groups. These servers provide an intimate environment where you can chat, share memories, coordinate activities, and maintain relationships with people you know personally. The smaller scale makes them ideal for casual conversations and personal connections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT970XC7203923YRMKY4\">Community Servers</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community servers</a></strong> are larger, invite-only spaces designed to bring together people from around the world who share common interests, hobbies, or goals. These servers focus on fostering learning, discussion, and connection within specific communities—whether that's gaming, art, technology, or countless other topics.</p>\n<p>Community servers come with enhanced moderation tools to help manage larger groups effectively, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032807371-Server-Insights-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Insights</a>: Analytics to understand your community's activity, growth patterns, and member engagement</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10989121220631-How-to-Protect-Your-Server-from-Raids-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raid Protection</a>: Advanced security features to protect against spam, bot attacks, and disruptive behavior</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rules</a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onboarding</a>: Structured systems to welcome new members, establish community guidelines, and create screening processes</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591-Community-Server-Welcome-Screen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Welcome Screen</a>: Customizable introduction for new members</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Discovery</a>: Ability to be found in Discord's server discovery feature (if eligible)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tools make Community servers well-suited for building thriving, organized communities that can scale while maintaining a positive environment for all members.</p>\n<div class=\"book-box\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Want to learn more?</strong></span>\n<p id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BP8PBTQ3YKA0476J2\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">For a deeper dive into server types and their specific features, check out our comprehensive </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14078261239831-Clarifying-Server-Types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clarifying Server Types article</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">, which covers additional details and best practices for choosing the right server type for your community.</span></p>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BFSEDK3NH6EJ1ADQK\">Getting Started with Discord Servers</h1>\n<p>Creating your first Discord server is a simple process that takes just a few minutes.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span></div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYM0S2ZJPD6M2M6QY10JXNW1\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!
