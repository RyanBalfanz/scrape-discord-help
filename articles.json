We know how important these changes are to our community.</p><h1 id=\"h_01KH6Y62PAJB4AEKQHN5XW4M8A\">Here’s what we want you to know:</h1><blockquote><ul>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-list-bold\" data-list-item-id=\"ef69340ee9123df7d86cc2fc144773c84\"><strong>Discord is not requiring everyone to complete a face scan or upload an ID to use Discord.</strong></li>\n<li class=\"wysiwyg-list-bold\" data-list-item-id=\"e8a2199d9fd70b73dd4bb0d1f69606ed9\"><strong>The vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today, without ever being asked to confirm their age.</strong></li>\n</ul></blockquote><p>You need to be an adult to access age-restricted experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings.</p><p>For the majority of adult users, we will be able to confirm your age group using information we already have. We use age prediction to determine, with high confidence, when a user is an adult. This allows many adults to access age-appropriate features without completing an explicit age check.</p><p>When additional confirmation is required, we offer multiple privacy-forward options through trusted partners.</p><ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e33eb934c5dc30d5ad1ea375bd66d89e0\">Facial scans never leave your device.

In a minority of cases when additional confirmation is required, we offer multiple privacy-forward options through trusted partners.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KH6Y0KZJKS8RKYKKWZNWQ928\">When do I need to go through age assurance?</h2><p>You must be a confirmed adult to access age-restricted content and experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings. </p><p>The majority of Discord users don’t access age restricted content and will never go through a facial age estimation flow or ID verification. In the minority of cases where we cannot confirm you as an adult and you need to access age-restricted areas and settings, then you will be asked to go through additional steps.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KH6Y0PMK6JG31JC9H7Y29GQJ\">How does Discord use this data?</h2><p>We only get your age from the ID verification process and an estimated age range from Facial Age Estimation. We use this information for safety purposes and to help us deliver age appropriate experiences on Discord. We will not use your age assurance information to target you with advertisements, and we don't sell your data. You can control <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy#4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how we use your data</a>.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KH6Y0TN516TTW44FNB9MCJQN\">How does Facial Age Estimation (”video selfie”) work?</h2><p>If you choose Facial Age Estimation, you’ll be prompted to record a short video selfie of your face. The Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on your device in real time when you are performing the verification. That means that facial scans never leave your device, and Discord and vendors never receive it. We only get your age group.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KH6Y105BEMRWF7SH0DY4X7Q3\">How is my age group data safe on Discord?</h2><p>Discord’s age assurance experience was designed to respect user privacy. We are partnering with dedicated age assurance vendors who specialize in performing these verifications in a privacy-forward way. These vendors were not involved in the September 2025 data breach of our customer service agent.</p><p>Our vendors perform these verifications in a way to minimize the data collected and stored. For FAE, the video selfie is processed on device and never stored. IDs are processed to get your age only and then deleted. Your identity is never associated with your Discord account.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KH6Y13FP9M9QEM0N27TZAVNR\">What are you getting from my ID or facial age estimation? What personal information do you receive?</h2><p>Discord only gets your age. That’s it. Your identity is never associated with your account.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KH6Y1P1NWEQBGQNY66JWFXXD\">How does the age inference model work?</h2><p>We leverage an advanced machine learning model developed at Discord to predict whether a user falls into a particular age group based on patterns of user behavior and several other signals associated with their account on Discord. </p><p>We only use these signals to assign users to an age group when our confidence level is high; when it isn't, users go through our standard age assurance flow to confirm their age. We do not use your message content in the age estimation model.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KH6Y1S5HSTB59KM89PEFMSMF\">How do content safety filters work?</h2><p>Discord’s content safety filters are part of our broader Teen Safety Assist and safety-by-default approach. They help reduce exposure to certain categories of potentially sensitive image-based media, especially for teens.</p><ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec51f55bac65276425c869b9e93d4e511\">\n<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/sexual-content-policy-explainer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mature Sexual Media</a> Filter: Helps identify visual media that may contain sexually explicit or suggestive material involving adults</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e4347bbd469b7d5e960deee298e8ba903\">\n<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/violence-graphic-content-policy-explainer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graphic Media</a> Filter: Helps identify image-based media that may contain violent or potentially disturbing visual material</li>\n</ul><p>These filters apply only to images and videos.

Each video codec has various tradeoffs, but they all have the same goal of storing, transmitting, and playing video efficiently.</p><p>The Discord app uses video codecs in several parts of its experience including: </p><ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e9da9e2c792a11f308caf8cee84aeba90\">File attachment playback</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e8b9c6c09f7be9dbddec3d42753d08a7f\">Quest videos</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ef2980d73489025c319ba7e911dc7749b\">Video calls</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e55c1c8c38828b04ab9e9e8e4f26be48a\">Go-Live screenshare</li>\n</ul><p>Discord relies on codecs provided by the operating system, such as Windows.

Codecs installed from the Microsoft Store will be used by Discord and other applications on the computer. </p><h2 id=\"h_01KG0M0A5ADZADCQQG0MQ7E72W\">Getting The AVC Codec</h2><p>The AVC codec is required for core Discord functionality such as playing most file attachments and participating in video calls. An AVC encoder is especially important for camera and Go-Live screensharing.

In the event Partner objects to a new subcontractor, Discord will use reasonable efforts to make available to Partner a change in the services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Partner’s use of the services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected-to subcontractor without unreasonably burdening Partner. </p><p>8. <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">International Data Transfers</span></strong>. </p><p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">a. Partner acknowledges and agrees that Discord may Process or transfer any Personal Data in or to a territory other than the territory in which the Personal Data was first collected under the Applicable Product Terms, including as set out in Schedule 2.  Discord will take all such measures as are necessary to ensure that any such Processing or transfer is in compliance with Data Privacy Laws. </p><p class=\"wysiwyg-indent1\">b. Transfer Mechanisms. To the extent that a transfer of Personal Data from Partner to Discord constitutes a Restricted Transfer to a country which does not benefit from an absolute adequacy decision  under the Data Privacy Laws, the following shall apply, as applicable:</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">i. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Data Transfers Subject to a Data Privacy Framework</span>. For transfers of Personal Data from Partner to Discord in the US, Discord is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, the UK extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework (collectively the “Alternative Transfer Mechanisms”) and the Alternative Transfer Mechanisms constitute the valid transfer mechanism. Notwithstanding the above, if a court of competent jurisdiction or supervisory authority orders that the Alternative Transfer Mechanism cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer Personal Data to the United States, then the Parties agree that the data transfer mechanisms in Sections 8.b.ii-iv., shall apply.</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">ii. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">EU Data Transfers.</span>  If Section 8(b)(i) does not apply, then with respect to Personal Data subject to the EU GDPR, the Partner and Discord agree to comply with the EU SCCs which shall form part of this Agreement, and take precedence over the rest of this Agreement as set forth in the EU SCC, and shall be completed as follows:</p><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e0afc7ca659ed7d6eff76799ffd79be32\">Discord acts as Partner’s Processor, therefore Module Two of the EU SCCs shall apply.   </li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e0e72c6d3491dabe12cc82960c5c03a19\">Clause 7 (the optional docking clause) is not included.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eb0dac7d54bfb7358cddf0732d57d7b2c\">Under Clause 9 (Use of subprocessors), the parties select Option 2 (General written authorization). The initial list of subprocessors is set forth below in Schedule 2 of this Agreement, and Discord shall update that list and inform Partner in writing at least 30 business days in advance of any intended additions or replacements of subprocessors.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e8d611f36a337447d7e4ab6f4c43f4af0\">Under Clause 11 (Redress), the optional requirement that data subjects be permitted to lodge a complaint with an independent dispute resolution body does not apply.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eecd9db12a5c6c360f8e924ad8c4707d1\">Under Clause 17 (Governing law), the parties choose Option 1 (the law of an EU Member State that allows for third-party beneficiary rights).  The parties select the law of The Netherlands.  All procedures will be conducted in English.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e828d7d1d9e89ce030c31317953dc5240\">Under Clause 18 (Choice of forum and jurisdiction), the parties select the courts in the City of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. </li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e96516a43f5770bb31386673b3f97187e\">Annexes I and II of the EU SCCs are set forth in Schedule 3 of the Agreement.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e75269e97abf0ed418ec276998ad23e57\">Annex III of the EU SCCs (List of subprocessors) is set forth in Schedule 2.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e781883220ad6d53098701322bb2d92b7\">By entering into this Agreement, the Parties are deemed to be signing the EU SCCs.</li>\n</ol><p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">iii. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">UK Data Transfers</span>. With respect to Personal Data subject to the UK GDPR, the Partner and Discord agree to comply with the UK SCCs which shall form part of this Agreement and take precedence over the rest of this Agreement as set forth in the UK SCCs. Undefined capitalized terms used in this provision shall mean the definitions in the UK SCCs. As permitted by clause 17 of the UK SCCs, the Parties agree to change the format of the information set out in Part 1 of the UK SCCs so that:</p><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec86a7b22eb77a19ed3ba4bfbfd9d7c07\">Table 1 of the UK SCCs: The Parties’ details shall be the Parties and their Affiliates to the extent any of them is involved in such transfer, including those set forth in Schedule 3. The Key Contact shall be the contacts set forth in Schedule 3.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eb53a6b78d25884f76cc6e43293aa504b\">Table 2 of the UK SCCs: The UK SCCs shall be appended to the EU SCCs as referenced above in Section 8(b)(ii).</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e88cd9cffdd0f1b03f627e2fdc9f6ef43\">Table 3 of the UK SCCs: Annex 1A, 1B, II, and III shall be set forth in Schedule 3.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e9c484fe7f6574f07e4f7aa9880eb6996\">Table 4 of the UK SCCs: A party may end this Agreement as set out in Section 19 of the UK SCCs.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e56891c36d6f81284980c3670a3edaca8\">By entering into this Agreement, the Parties are deemed to be signing the UK SCCs and its applicable Tables and Appendix Information.</li>\n</ol><p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">iv. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Swiss Data Transfers</span>. With respect to Personal Data transferred from Switzerland for which the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (“<strong>FADP</strong>”) (and not the law in any European Economic Area jurisdiction) governs the international nature of the transfer, the EU SCCs shall apply and shall be deemed to have the following differences to the extent required by the FADP as follows:</p><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eec0dd862b541fe06665ee806033f0d29\">References to the GDPR in the EU SCCs are to be understood as references to the FADP insofar as the data transfers are subject exclusively to the FADP and not to the GDPR.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ea3da5fe25b66031a36be8f51ff37a0b2\">The term “member state” in the EU SCCs shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude data subjects in Switzerland from the possibility of suing for their rights in their place of habitual residence (Switzerland) in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the EU SCCs.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e90d2d4cceb2b5f490da6257080b3c924\">References to personal data in the EU SCCs also refer to data about identifiable legal entities until the entry into force of revisions to the FADP that eliminate this broader scope.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e6b832d12e13962116bd99274c9430616\">Under Annex I(C) of the EU SCCs (Competent supervisory authority): where the transfer is subject exclusively to the FADP and not the GDPR, the supervisory authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, and where the transfer is subject to both the FADP and the GDPR, the supervisory authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner insofar as the transfer is governed by the FADP, and the supervisory authority is as set forth in the EU SCCs insofar as the transfer is governed by the GDPR. </li>\n</ol><p>9. <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Audit, Compliance and Remediation</span></strong>. Discord will make available to Partner information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and will allow for and contribute to audits conducted by Partner or another auditor (at Partner’s sole cost and expense) designated by Partner on reasonable notice by Partner and no more frequently than once every 12 months.  Partner shall conduct audits during standard working hours and use all reasonable endeavours to minimise disruption to Discord. </p><p>10. <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Return or Destruction of Personal Data</span></strong>. Except to the extent required otherwise by Data Privacy Laws, Discord will, at the choice of Partner, return to Partner and/or securely destroy all Personal Data upon (a) written request of Partner or (b) termination of the Applicable Product Terms. Except to the extent prohibited by Data Privacy Laws, Discord will inform Partner if it is not able to return or delete any Data. </p><p>11. <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Term</span></strong>. The effective date of this Agreement is the date of the latest signature of a Party. This Agreement shall remain in force for the duration of the Applicable Product Terms and for long as Discord processes Personal Data.</p><p>12. <strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Survival</span></strong>. The provisions of this Agreement survive the termination or expiration of the Applicable Product Terms for so long as Discord or its subcontractors Process any Personal Data.  </p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong>Schedule 1</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong>DETAILS OF PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING</strong></p><div><figure class=\"wysiwyg-table\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><table class=\"wysiwyg-table-resized\">\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 35%;\">\n<col style=\"width: 65%;\">\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Instruction</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>i.

      "body": "<p>Effective Date: January 22, 2026</p><p>Welcome! Thank you for your interest in Discord's advertising business products and services (collectively, \"Business Services\"). The Business Services are “services” as defined in <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Discord’s Terms of Service</span></a>.</p><p>These Advertising Business Services Terms (\"Business Terms\") apply to your access to and use of the Business Services and set forth the legal obligations between us and you.</p><p>When we say \"Discord,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" in these Business Terms, we mean Discord Inc. and its subsidiaries and related companies, unless otherwise set forth in additional terms applicable to a given Business Service.  When we say “Partner,” “you,” or “yours,” we mean the entity identified in an Insertion Order (“<strong>IO</strong>”)or other ordering document that has elected to use the Business Services.</p><p>When we say \"Terms\" in these Business Terms, we mean, collectively, these Business Terms, the applicable Insertion Order to which these Business Terms are incorporated by reference, our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Terms of Service</span></a> (including our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Discord Community Guidelines</span></a>), our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/25516720403223-Ads-Policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Ads Policy</span></a>, and any other applicable terms, policies, and guidelines we make available. If you use other Discord business products and services in connection with the Business Services, then the terms for those other products or services also apply to you. If there is a conflict among these documents, the following order of precedence applies (highest to lowest): (1) the applicable Insertion Order, (2) these Business Terms, and (3) any additional terms, policies, and guidelines. This order of precedence applies unless the conflicting provision in a lower-priority document expressly states that it controls over these Business Terms with respect to a specific subject matter.</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Section 9: Disputes incorporates the <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms#16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">dispute resolution provision</span></a> from our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Terms of Service</span></a>, which includes an arbitration clause and class action waiver that applies to all U.S.-based Discord users including users of the Business Services. Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.</p><p><strong>Section 1: Use of the Business Services</strong></p><p><strong>a. License to you</strong></p><p>Subject to your compliance with the Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable license to access and use the Business Services solely as necessary to optimize<em> </em>the applicable Ad campaign(s) (inclusive of Quests) on Discord to the extent permitted under the Terms. We reserve all rights, title, and interest not expressly granted in the Terms and you may not access or use the Business Services except as set forth in the Terms.</p><p><strong>b. Restrictions</strong></p><p>In addition to any restrictions under Discord’s Terms of Service, you will not (and will not attempt to or permit or enable others to): (i)  use the Business Services in a manner or for a purpose not permitted under these Business Terms; (ii) gather, access, or otherwise process any personal data via the Business Services for any purpose without Discord's prior written consent; (iii) transmit any malicious code, viruses, or other harmful software that could damage or impair the Business Services; (iv) sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, license, sublicense, or provide access to the Business Services, and the information contained therein, without Discord's express prior written approval; (v) use the Business Services to build a competing product or service, or (vi) use the Business Services, or any information contained therein, for the purposes of training any AI or machine learning model.</p><p><strong>Section 3: Representations and Warranties</strong></p><p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you are an entity validly existing and in good standing under the laws of your jurisdiction of incorporation or organization; (ii) you have the full power and rights to perform your obligations under these Business Terms; (iii) you will comply with the Business Terms and all applicable laws and regulations, including export control, economic sanctions, and anti-boycott laws when using the Business Services; and (iv) all information provided or made available by you via or in connection with your use of the Business Services is complete and accurate in all material respects.</p><p>If you are using the Business Services as agent for another individual or entity, then you represent and warrant that: (i) you are authorized to, and do, bind that individual or entity to these Business Terms; and (ii) all of your actions, and other such entities’ actions, in connection with these Business Terms are and will be within the scope of the agency relationship between you and that individual or entity, and in accordance with any applicable legal and fiduciary duties. If you are using the Business Services as principal in connection with services you provide to another individual or entity, then you represent and warrant that you will procure that such individual or entity will comply with, and you will remain primarily liable for any obligations ascribed to or actions taken by that individual or entity under these Business Terms.</p><p><strong>Section 4: Intellectual </strong>Property and Ownership</p><p>Discord owns all rights, title, and interest in the Business Services and any data, insights, analytics, or reports derived from the Business Services. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved Discord.</p><p><strong>Section 5: Termination</strong></p><p>Discord may terminate these Business Terms, and modify, suspend, terminate access to, or discontinue the availability of any Business Services, at any time in its sole discretion.<strong>  </strong>Where practicable, Discord will use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of any material modification, suspension, or discontinuation of Business Services, but shall have no liability for failure to do so. Upon termination, you will immediately stop using the Business Service.</p><p><strong>Section 6: Warranty Disclaimer</strong></p><p>DISCORD MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE BUSINESS SERVICES. BUSINESS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. DISCORD DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BUSINESS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SOLELY AT DISCORD'S DISCRETION AND DISCORD HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE, CONTINUE PROVIDING, OR TO UPDATE ANY BUSINESS SERVICES.  YOUR USE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BUSINESS SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO THE THIRD-PARTY’S TERMS. DISCORD IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES INCURRED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF ANY THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.</p><p><strong>Section 7: Indemnification</strong></p><p>You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Discord and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents against all claims, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal costs and all other reasonable professional costs and expenses) (\"Claims\") arising from or related to your breach of the Business Terms or any claim that your use of the Business Services violates any third party rights or applicable laws.  Discord will promptly notify you in writing of any indemnification claim, but any failure to notify you will not relieve you from any indemnity liability or obligation, except to the extent you are materially prejudiced by that failure. Discord will reasonably cooperate with you, at your expense, in connection with the defense of any indemnification claim. You will not compromise or settle any claim without Discord's prior written consent, which Discord may provide in its sole discretion.</p><p><strong>Section 8: Limitation of Liability</strong></p><p>IN NO EVENT WILL DISCORD OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF REVENUE OR PROFITS, OR FOR LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, OR FOR ANY EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; AND DISCORD AND ITS AFFILIATES AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 AND (B) THE AMOUNT OF  FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO DISCORD UNDER THE INSERTION ORDER GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p><p><strong>Section 9: Disputes</strong></p><p>For any disputes arising from or related to the Business Services, the <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms#16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">“Settling disputes between you and Discord” section in our Terms of Service</span></a> applies, where references to the “services” will mean the Business Services, “these terms” will mean these Business Terms, and the date for emailing an opt-out notice is within 30 days of the applicable IO Effective Date. Notwithstanding anything contrary in the Discord Terms of Service, the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and New York law will apply, regardless of conflict of laws rules, to these Business Terms.  Any arbitration will be seated in and take place in New York, New York.  Any disputes that are not subject to arbitration will be resolved in the state and federal courts in New York, New York, and the parties each consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in these courts.  </p><p><strong>Section 10: Modifications</strong></p><p>We may update these Business Terms from time to time. We will provide you with reasonable notice and post updated terms in advance of the updated terms taking effect, unless the changes are urgent (for example, to comply with applicable law or correct non-material errors). If you continue to access or use the Business Services after the changes have taken effect, it means that you agree to the changes. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Business Services. You can review the most current version of these Business Terms at any time by visiting this page. </p><p><strong>Section 11: Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>To the extent permitted by law, we each agree to contract in the English language and if we provide a translation of the Business Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The term “including” means “including without limitation.” The Business Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Business Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Business Terms, and Discord does not take action right away, this does not mean that Discord is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Business Terms are the entire agreement between you and Discord relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject (unless, and solely to the extent, you and Discord have entered into a separate written agreement to expressly supersede). For information about how to contact Discord, please visit our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Terms of Service</span></a>. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate, or otherwise transfer any of your rights or obligations under the Business Terms to any third party without the prior written consent of Discord. For clarity, upon a Discord-approved transfer, the Business Terms apply to the transferee as “you” and they assume the obligations and liabilities of the transferor under the Business Terms. Any transfer in violation of this provision is null and void. Any change of control or material ownership of you is hereby deemed an assignment. </p>",

We’ll send an email before the paid membership begins, and you’ll have the opportunity to cancel before you are charged by following the steps <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/19580873036695\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</div><p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a trial?</strong></p><p>A: There is no charge for this 2-week Nitro trial. However, there will be a temporary hold placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm that the submitted payment method is valid. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.<br>After you redeem the trial offer, we reverse the temporary hold to return the funds, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><div class=\"info box\">Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><p><strong>Q: If I have Nitro Credit, can I still claim the 2-week Nitro trial offer? </strong></p><p>A: Yes, if you have Nitro Credit, you are still eligible to claim the trial offer if you meet all other eligibility criteria. Your Nitro Credit will automatically activate after your 2-week trial, before your paid subscription begins. If you have more questions about Nitro Credit, learn more <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/26362805097623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>",

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KC4Q5DEWVN0SQEWGJAZKFY6Y\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2><p><strong>Q: What if I didn't receive an email from Epic Games Store with the Nitro promo link, even if I have an Epic Games Store account?</strong></p><p>A: In order to receive an email from Epic Games Store with the Nitro promo link, you must have an Epic Games Store account.</p><p>Additionally, make sure that you've opted to receive marketing emails from the Epic Games Store.

WARP+ enhances your privacy by encrypting a user’s traffic that makes it harder to track or sell your data.

Your activity within Discord follows our standard privacy practices, which you can learn about in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this slow down my internet connection?</strong></p><p>A: WARP+ is designed for speed, but because it encrypts your traffic, you may notice slight changes in connection performance. Most users won't notice a difference during regular browsing. </p><p><strong>Q: WARP+ is affecting my gaming performance. What should I do?</strong></p><p>A: Because WARP+ encrypts all your internet traffic, it may occasionally increase latency in some online games. If you notice performance issues while gaming, try turning off WARP+ temporarily while you play, then turn it back on when you're done. Your privacy protection will resume automatically.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use WARP+ on mobile devices?</strong></p><p>A: The Nitro Privacy Perk is currently only available on Windows and Mac desktop apps. We're always exploring ways to bring more value to Nitro subscribers across all platforms.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this hide my Discord activity from Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, WARP+ enhances your privacy while browsing outside of Discord. Discord can still see your activity within the Discord platform according to your privacy settings and and our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>. WARP+ does not provide IP masking for Discord platform activity.</p><p><strong>Q: What's the difference between WARP and WARP+?</strong></p><p>A: WARP is Cloudflare's free privacy service, while WARP+ (included with Nitro) offers enhanced performance and routing. When you have an active Nitro subscription, you automatically get access to WARP+ features. If your subscription ends, you'll have access to the standard WARP features.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use this perk if I already have other privacy tools installed?</strong></p><p>A: You can have WARP+ installed alongside other privacy tools, but running multiple services simultaneously may cause connection conflicts. We recommend choosing one privacy solution at a time for the best experience.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this perk impact safety on Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, we remain deeply committed to creating positive experiences for our users and this tool is part of that commitment. Everything you could ever want to know about safety on Discord can be found <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">here</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will WARP+ allow me to use an IP address from another country? </strong></p><p>A: No. WARP+ will assign you a Cloudflare IP address corresponding to the region in which you are connecting from. </p><p><br> </p><p> </p>",

If you attempt to claim a gifted item that you already own in-game, the gift sender will be refunded. Note that purchasers and gift receivers must attempt to claim items within 14 days to ensure Discord can issue any eligible refunds. </p><p><strong>Q: Can I purchase from the Marvel Rivals Shop without linking my account?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can purchase from the shop without linking your account, but you will need to link your account to claim the item.

Your activity within Discord follows our standard privacy practices, which you can learn about in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this slow down my internet connection?</strong></p><p>A: WARP+ is designed for speed, but because it encrypts your traffic, you may notice slight changes in connection performance. Most users won't notice a difference during regular browsing. </p><p><strong>Q: WARP+ is affecting my gaming performance. What should I do?</strong></p><p>A: Because WARP+ encrypts all your internet traffic, it may occasionally increase latency in some online games. If you notice performance issues while gaming, try turning off WARP+ temporarily while you play, then turn it back on when you're done. Your privacy protection will resume automatically.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use WARP+ on mobile devices?</strong></p><p>A: The Nitro Privacy Perk is currently only available on Windows and Mac desktop apps. We're always exploring ways to bring more value to Nitro subscribers across all platforms.</p><p><strong>Q: Does this hide my Discord activity from Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, WARP+ enhances your privacy while browsing outside of Discord. Discord can still see your activity within the Discord platform according to your privacy settings and and our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Privacy Policy</span></a>. WARP+ does not provide IP masking for Discord platform activity.</p><p><strong>Q: What's the difference between WARP and WARP+?</strong></p><p>A: WARP is Cloudflare's free privacy service, while WARP+ (included with Nitro) offers enhanced performance and routing. When you have an active Nitro subscription, you automatically get access to WARP+ features. If your subscription ends, you'll have access to the standard WARP features.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use this perk if I already have other privacy tools installed?</strong></p><p>A: You can have WARP+ installed alongside other privacy tools, but running multiple services simultaneously may cause connection conflicts. We recommend choosing one privacy solution at a time for the best experience.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this perk impact safety on Discord?</strong></p><p>A: No, we remain deeply committed to creating positive experiences for our users and this tool is part of that commitment. Everything you could ever want to know about safety on Discord can be found <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety-library\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">here</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Q: Will WARP+ allow me to use an IP address from another country? </strong></p><p>A: No. WARP+ will assign you a Cloudflare IP address corresponding to the region in which you are connecting from. </p>",

Without Discord's standard safety features, you should take extra precautions to protect yourself in these external spaces.</p><p><strong>Before You Join:</strong> Avoid joining servers hosted by people you don’t know and trust in real life or from well-known groups you trust. Be selective—these servers may have different safety features from those you’re used to on Discord, so your choice of which servers to join becomes your primary safety measure.</p><p><strong>Protect Your Privacy:</strong> Refrain from sharing personal information like your real name, location, age, school, or contact details on game servers. Be especially cautious of anyone who tries to move conversations to other platforms, offers unexpected gifts or special treatment, or asks you to keep interactions secret. These are red flags for potentially harmful behavior that can escalate quickly in unmoderated spaces.</p><p><strong>Use Available Safety Tools:</strong> Consider enabling any safety features the server offers like chat filters, allowlist controls, and moderation plugins. When creating your own server, use allowlist controls to limit access to known friends, enable moderation tools, and establish clear behavioral expectations from the start. Remember that these tools may differ from what you're used to with Discord's built-in protections.</p><p><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If someone makes you uncomfortable, leave immediately. Your safety is more important than game progress, maintaining friendships, or avoiding awkwardness. It's never your fault if someone acts inappropriately toward you. Report concerning behavior <em>happening in the game server</em> to the server admin if you trust them, or use the game host's reporting system (like <a href=\"https://shockbyte.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Shockbyte's support form</span></a>). If you see behavior that violates our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Terms of Service</span></a> or <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Community Guidelines</span></a> <em>happening on Discord</em>, please <a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">report it directly to us</span></a>.</p><p><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> These servers exist outside Discord's safety ecosystem, meaning the automatic detection systems and rapid response teams you might expect aren't available. Maintain strong boundaries, be skeptical of unusual requests, and prioritize your wellbeing over gameplay.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K7Q3AJERHPMXVXGTSMN52DZK\">How to Join a Game Server</h2><p>Once created, game servers will appear in the new Game Servers tab at the top of your server.

Boosts used to level up your server <strong>do not</strong> count toward unlocking Game Servers.

Once a game server is created, the Game Servers tab will appear in your server.</p><p><strong>Q: How many Boosts does it cost to create a Game Server?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> The number of Boosts required depends on the <strong>game and plan</strong> you choose. The least expensive option starts at <strong>3 Boosts</strong>, with certain games and higher-tier plans requiring more. All Boosts allocated go directly toward that game server, there’s <strong>no extra Boost cost</strong> just to unlock the feature.</p><p><strong>Q: How many Game Servers can be created in one Discord server?</strong></p><p>A: You can have a maximum of 10 Game Servers per Discord server.</p><p><strong>Q: What does the current game server’s status mean? </strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/35684686208919\" width=\"624\" height=\"324\"></strong></p><h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\" id=\"h_01K7Q3ATDXXJ8WMYKQPFQ2NW7S\">\n<span style=\"color: #666666;\">Server Status of a Game Server</span> </h4><p>A: Depending on the state of the server, you may see a variety of different Server Statuses.
