This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><div class=\"info-box\">Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K20JEN2SYZAXMAFSMH89160J\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2><p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

Think of servers as virtual meeting places that bring people together around shared interests, hobbies, or relationships. Each server is organized with different channels dedicated to specific purposes—whether that's text conversations, voice chats, or media sharing—making it easy to keep discussions organized and accessible.</p>\n<p>Discord servers are free to create and can accommodate anywhere from a small group of friends to massive communities with thousands of members. They offer flexibility in organization, moderation tools, and customization options that make them suitable for virtually any type of group or community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96AZHQ9EJVPG49MNJ2\">Understanding Different Types of Servers</h1>\n<p>Discord offers two main server types, each designed for different community needs and scales:</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT96THW43XKZDGD1FRBX\">Friend Servers</h2>\n<p><strong>Friend servers</strong> are private, invite-only spaces perfect for staying connected with your close friends or smaller groups. These servers provide an intimate environment where you can chat, share memories, coordinate activities, and maintain relationships with people you know personally. The smaller scale makes them ideal for casual conversations and personal connections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYHHBT970XC7203923YRMKY4\">Community Servers</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community servers</a></strong> are larger, invite-only spaces designed to bring together people from around the world who share common interests, hobbies, or goals. These servers focus on fostering learning, discussion, and connection within specific communities—whether that's gaming, art, technology, or countless other topics.</p>\n<p>Community servers come with enhanced moderation tools to help manage larger groups effectively, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032807371-Server-Insights-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Insights</a>: Analytics to understand your community's activity, growth patterns, and member engagement</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10989121220631-How-to-Protect-Your-Server-from-Raids-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raid Protection</a>: Advanced security features to protect against spam, bot attacks, and disruptive behavior</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rules</a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onboarding</a>: Structured systems to welcome new members, establish community guidelines, and create screening processes</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591-Community-Server-Welcome-Screen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Welcome Screen</a>: Customizable introduction for new members</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Discovery</a>: Ability to be found in Discord's server discovery feature (if eligible)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tools make Community servers well-suited for building thriving, organized communities that can scale while maintaining a positive environment for all members.</p>\n<div class=\"book-box\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Want to learn more?</strong></span>\n<p id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BP8PBTQ3YKA0476J2\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">For a deeper dive into server types and their specific features, check out our comprehensive </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14078261239831-Clarifying-Server-Types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clarifying Server Types article</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">, which covers additional details and best practices for choosing the right server type for your community.</span></p>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JYHHBT9BFSEDK3NH6EJ1ADQK\">Getting Started with Discord Servers</h1>\n<p>Creating your first Discord server is a simple process that takes just a few minutes.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span></div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JYM0S2ZJPD6M2M6QY10JXNW1\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed.

However, you cannot downgrade subscriptions - you'll need to wait until your current subscription ends to switch to a lower tier. </p>\n<p>Please note that if you upgrade or cancel your Nitro Classic subscription, you will not be able to re-subscribe to Classic.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to use the same payment method for upgrades as my subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>A: For security and billing consistency, your payment method for upgrades must match the one used for your recurring subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I use a different payment method for my upgrade?</strong></p>\n<p>A: To use a different payment method:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First change your subscription's payment method</li>\n<li>Then proceed with the upgrade</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note: The payment method you choose for the upgrade will become your new default payment method for future subscription payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will upgrading change my billing date?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, upgrading your subscription will not change your billing date. Your next payment will still occur on the same day.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I upgrade from a monthly to yearly subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>A: When upgrading from monthly to yearly, you'll be charged for the yearly plan minus the prorated credit from your remaining monthly subscription time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will I lose my current benefits when upgrading?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you'll keep all your current benefits plus gain additional features from the upgraded tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I upgrade from a monthly to an annual plan?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, you can change your billing cycle when upgrading.

(“Media Company”) and the advertiser designated on an IO (“Advertiser”), or, if applicable, Advertiser’s agency designated on an IO (“Agency”).  The terms of this Discord Addendum will control over and fully supersede any similar, conflicting, inconsistent or overlapping terms in the IAB Terms or other parts of an IO; however, if an IO expressly states that certain terms set forth in the IO are intended to supersede the terms of this Discord Addendum, then, in the event of conflict, those terms of the applicable IO will control only for that IO and only to the extent of such conflict. Any purchase order terms, “clickthrough” or other online agreements, or other similar documents made available to Media Company by Advertiser or Agency are hereby rejected by Media Company and will not apply to any Quest. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings given to such terms in the IAB Terms. </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Where Advertiser is purchasing directly from Media Company, (i) Section 2 and any references to Agency herein will be deemed deleted and will not apply; and (ii) all references in the IAB Terms to Agency, will be deemed to be references to Advertiser.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">1.

Media Company will implement a promotional campaign on its platform (the “Discord Platform”) for Advertiser’s applicable property designated on an IO (the “Advertiser Property”) where eligible users of the Discord Platform will be able to complete certain agreed-upon tasks relating to the Advertiser Property and earn certain agreed-upon rewards (“Rewards”), as further detailed in an applicable IO (each such campaign, a “Quest”).  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">b. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Quest T&amp;Cs</span><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">.

The Quest T&amp;Cs will address, at a minimum (i) user eligibility requirements and any criteria and tasks that must be satisfied by a user in order to receive a Reward; (ii) the nature of the applicable Reward, including whether the Reward will be supplied by Media Company (each, a “Media Company Reward”) or Advertiser (each, an “Advertiser Reward”); and (iv) any other terms, conditions and limitations pertaining to the redemption and use of the Reward.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">c. </span><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Advertiser Rewards</span><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">.

Media Company will obtain Advertiser’s or Agency’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) for any Media Company Reward that contains or is derived from Advertising Materials. Media Company Rewards may not be available to users in certain regions where not supported by the Discord Platform.

Once validated, the exemption automatically applies to all future purchases.</span></div>\n<p>To help you get your tax exemption approved quickly, here's what we look for when reviewing your request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Valid ID Check</strong>: We'll verify your VAT/Tax ID with the official tax authorities to ensure it's current and valid.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Regional Verification</strong>: Your tax exemption must be applicable in your specific country or region.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Matching Addresses</strong>: For your security, your payment method's billing address needs to match the country where your tax exemption is registered.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation Review</strong>: We'll check that all your invoice details align with our verification records.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Final Review</strong>: Our Support team will carefully review your application to ensure everything is in order.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Info</strong>: Having all these items ready before submission can help speed up the approval process.</span></div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMFBKRE9FEAY18FW8E\">What Happens After Submission?</h1>\n<p>Once you submit your tax exemption request, our dedicated Support team will carefully review your application.
