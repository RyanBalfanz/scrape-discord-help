This is currently out to 100% of users on the Canary and PTB versions of the Discord app. There is no ETA at this time as to when this will be fully rolled out to all users on the Stable version of Discord.</p>\n<p>After this date, you will experience the following changes in Game Overlay behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game Overlay is now enabled by default for all games.</li>\n<li>Game Overlay will work in windowed fullscreen mode and windowed borderless fullscreen mode, but will not work in true fullscreen mode.\n<ul>\n<li>True fullscreen mode on desktop means that other computer applications cannot be displayed over the application that’s in true fullscreen mode.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Game Overlay will be hidden when the game window is not in focus.</li>\n<li>Screensharing the game window will not capture the Game Overlay, but screensharing the full screen will still capture the Game Overlay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J42RQ6P0QAC4P99CCMDFF134\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: What do I do if I always run my game in true fullscreen mode?</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>A: Most games support borderless fullscreen mode, so you can switch to this mode to continue getting Discord’s Game Overlay in game.</p>\n<p>If you need to run the game in true fullscreen mode for any reason, there’s also a global <strong>Enable legacy overlay</strong> option in <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Game Overlay</strong>. Please note that this option may be removed in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25289838883991\" width=\"668\" height=\"376\"><br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I keep using the legacy Game Overlay?</strong><br>A: You can continue using it as long as the option exists in the app, but our goal is to eventually move everyone over to the revamped Game Overlay so they can enjoy a more stable and performant experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if the game I play only works with the legacy Game Overlay?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Please first check that you are running borderless fullscreen mode, or sometimes called “windowed” fullscreen mode. The revamped Game Overlay should work in this mode.</p>\n<p>If you still experience issues with it, please reach out to our <a href=\"http://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Support team</a> for further assistance.</p>"

The disclosure should be prominent enough for consumers to view and understand it easily when they are reading posts.  Such disclosures will be: (a) unavoidable, (b) made in the same form and format of each type of endorsement (for example, if the post is a video of a person speaking, it should be superimposed on the video, spoken aloud, as well as in the video text description), and (c) at the beginning of the post (and if the post is livestreamed or longer than 60 seconds, repeatedly through the post). </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">2.2 By way of example, Discord requires that Provider include the following disclosures in a video: </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(a) a text description statement in the video description text, such as: “#ad”, “#sponsored” or “#Discordpartner”, “Discord agency employee”;</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(b) a verbal statement such as “This video is sponsored by Discord”;  and</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(c) text superimposed over the video, such as: “#ad”, “#sponsored” or “#Discordpartner”, “Discord agency employee.”</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Endorsement Content Requirements.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">3.1 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Honest Assessment</span>. Provider will ensure that it and any Influencers it engages only make statements that reflect honest and truthful opinions that are reflective of  Provider or Influencer’s (as applicable) actual experiences using Discord’s products and services. Provider will ensure that all Endorsement Content will clearly state that the views expressed do not represent the views of Discord (unless they were directed by Discord).  If a statement is one that Discord has instructed the Provider to post, Provider will ensure it or any Influencers it engages will make this fact clear to viewers.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">3.2 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Truthful and Accurate</span>. Provider will ensure it and any Influencers it engages only make factual statements about any Discord’s or a competitor’s services’ characteristic or quality, as verified by Discord, including all expressly stated or implied messaging.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">3.3 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quality Standards</span>. Provider will ensure that any statements made in connection with or in Endorsement Content will be consistent with the positive images and/or goodwill with which Discord wishes to associate, including ensuring Endorsement Content does not link to or include content that is sexual, violent, offensive or otherwise inappropriate for the audience for which it was intended.  Provider will ensure that Endorsement Content conforms with the Discord Community Guidelines available at <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://discord.com/guidelines</span></a> or other URL that Discord may provide from time to time.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>E-Mail and Electronic Messages. </strong>Unless expressly requested in writing, neither Provider nor any Influencers may send any emails/electronic messages on Discord’s behalf.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Influencers.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">5.1 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Engagement</span><strong>.  </strong>Provider will not engage, manage, or compensate Influencers for participating in any activity relating to Services unless expressly required under an applicable SOW. Provider will thoroughly screen all Influencers proposed to and engaged by Provider on Discord’s behalf. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">5.2 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Compliance</span>.  Provider will review all Endorsement Content to ensure compliance with the MSA and this Appendix. As between the parties, Provider is solely responsible for, and will ensure Influencers and Endorsement Content complies with the following:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(a) All applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including disclosures regarding advertising, paid, or sponsored content); </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(b) The terms of the MSA, including this Social Media Appendix; </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(c) The Discord Community Guidelines available at <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://discord.com/guidelines</span></a> or other URL that Discord may provide from time to time; and</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">(d) Discord Branding Guidelines available at <a href=\"https://discord.com/branding\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">https://discord.com/branding</span></a> or other URL that Discord may provide from time to time.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">5.3 <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Monitoring.</span> Provider will implement guidelines, rules, and protocols for reviewing and monitoring the activities of Influencers and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the MSA, including, without limitation, termination of any noncompliant Influencer’s participation in the campaign and association with Discord where appropriate.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Content Review. </strong>Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Discord, Provider will ensure that Discord reviews all Endorsement Content, including during the Endorsement Content’s conception (e.g., concepts and storyboards) prior to publication on Social Media.  For clarity, all Endorsement Content is subject to the approval and acceptance provisions set forth in the MSA. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Content Removal.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">7.1 Provider will immediately remove any content relating to Discord, its products or its services, those of its competitors or those associated with Discord, upon notice from Discord that it finds the content objectionable.  Further, Discord expects that Provider will promptly remove any content for which it receives a legitimate complaint or which Provider later becomes aware may be in violation of the law or otherwise violate third party rights.  </p>\n<p>7.2 If Provider finds that any Endorsement Content does not comply with any law or regulation, the terms of the MSA, any guideline or policy provided to it, or is otherwise objectionable,  Provider will: (i) immediately notify Discord; and (ii) use best efforts to ensure that the applicable Influencer immediately deletes or amends any non-compliant Endorsement Content.  Upon Discord’s request to remove or delete any Endorsement Content at any time for any reason, Provider will use best efforts to ensure that content is removed and deleted within as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after receiving the request.</p>"

Can I also take part in this promotion? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you previously had a Discord Nitro membership at any point on your accounts and have had a Nitro Classic or Nitro Basic membership in the past 12 months, you are ineligible to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p>If you have had a Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting membership active on your account and you’ve never had a Nitro membership,  you will be able to redeem this promotion and replace it with the 1 month Nitro membership.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1QBC9CKDF2MJJ8P47CY966K\"><strong>HOWEVER, please note: By choosing to activate this 1 month trial, you will lose any features associated with your current memberships, and **you will not receive a refund for any remaining value on your current membership**.</strong></h3>\n<p>At the end of the promotion period, you'll be converted to a paying Nitro membership per month unless you cancel your membership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J1QBC9CKZ6T7PASVZP4W0BKP\">Payment Info and Membership Questions</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a membership plan, at the end of your 1 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p>\n<p>However, you can cancel the Nitro membership at any time before the end of the 1 month.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a trial promotion?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is a trial, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1QBC9CK2WWF9ZVT6ASCV2PH\"><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J1QBC9CKRZ9H04MT209T8Z71\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro membership so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month perk.</p>\n<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a \"This gift has been claimed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if you are given an invalid promo and we will not be able to provide a new promo.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error.</strong></p>\n<p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are ineligible for this promotion</li>\n<li>The promotion is invalid</li>\n<li>The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>\n<li>The link is invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem.

If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link in your SteelSeries account.</p>\n<p>If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their SteelSeries account.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p>\n<p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified. Make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift.”</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like your email isn’t verified, make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift” error, you are trying to redeem this Nitro promotion on a Discord account with an email that hasn’t been verified yet.</p>\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/213219267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this support article</a> on how to resend the email verification for your Discord account.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1G83KS2DRYN4T2YCATV4M8X\">\n<strong>NOTE: </strong>Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J1G47CESHR9M19FS19X0G18J\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

This filter can help you reduce exposure to offensive or unwanted language, giving you a more comfortable experience on Discord. It works by redacting detected keywords with asterisks (****) from a pre-selected library of words. </p>\n<p>The filter is opt-in, and allows you to turn it on and off whenever you’d like. This filter only runs on your Discord client locally, meaning, this automatic filtering does not happen on Discord servers and Discord does not read your messages to power this filter. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J1QCP3DHMW0H5RBHW63GF6VP\">How to Enable/Disable the Language Filter</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1QCP3DHCGKAW56ZM44FHH5W\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">This feature is available on desktop, browser, and mobile.</span></h3>\n<p>1.

The filter works directly on your device, so your messages stay private and are not sent to Discord’s servers for filtering.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What types of keywords are filtered?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The filter uses the same keyword list as<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/auto-moderation-in-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Automod</a>, which filters words from a preset list selected by Discord of commonly flagged words in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Insults and Slurs</strong>: Personally insulting material, including terms that may be considered slurs or hate speech.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sensitive Content</strong>: Sexually explicit language.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severe Profanity</strong>: Egregious forms of profanity, while still allowing for mild forms of cursing or swearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I add my own keywords to this list?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, the filter is not customizable.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I turn off or disable the language filter?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, the filter is opt-in and can be enabled or disabled in the <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> tab in your  <strong>User Settings </strong>at any time. This setting is disabled by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I view the blocked word in the message without having to turn the filter off?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you will have to disable the filter to view blocked words.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will we support other languages besides English?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We’ll explore options for supporting other languages in future versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where will the filter work?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The filter works in DMs, GDMs (group messages), or in servers where server moderators have not enabled<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/auto-moderation-in-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Automod</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will the language filter apply to all devices I use Discord on?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, the filter setting will apply across all devices you use Discord on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What should I do if I find a word that should be filtered, but isn’t?</strong></p>\n<p>A: There is no way to provide feedback on specific requests, but we’ll continue to evolve the keyword list overtime.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.
