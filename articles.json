These sellers often advertise through unsolicited messages, social media, or unofficial websites. To identify them, look for offers that require external payments, unusual URLs, or methods that don’t involve the Discord app or official Amazon store. Remember: if it’s not from a Discord source described in this article, it’s not official.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What does a phishing attempt look like?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Phishing attempts often appear as fake messages or links designed to trick you into providing sensitive information, like your login credentials or payment details. Common signs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Messages claiming you’ve won or received free products or rewards, like Nitro, but requiring you to click a suspicious link.</li>\n<li>Threats to your account status unless you take immediate action.</li>\n<li>Requests for your password, account login, or personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Discord will never ask for your login details or for your payment information through unsolicited messages. Always verify links and contact <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord support</a> directly if you’re unsure.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What are safe messaging practices to avoid unsolicited scams?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> To protect yourself from unsolicited messages and scams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid engaging with messages from unknown users, especially those offering deals or rewards.</li>\n<li>Enable <strong>Safe Direct Messaging</strong> under <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> to automatically scan DMs from non-friends for harmful content.</li>\n<li>Report suspicious messages or users by following the steps outlined <a href=\"https://dis.gd/howtoreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Never click on links from untrusted sources. Even if they appear to come from someone you know, accounts can be compromised.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #434343;\">If you ever need to verify if a source is a legitimate Discord source or not, you can reach out to the </span><a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord support team</a><span style=\"color: #434343;\">.</span></p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JFBDZDD0SGKQT5Q6X8H47X2K\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

(“<strong>Media Company</strong>”) and the advertiser designated on an IO (“<strong>Advertiser</strong>”), or, if applicable, Advertiser’s agency designated on an IO (“<strong>Agency</strong>”).  The terms of this Discord Addendum will control over and fully supersede any similar, conflicting, inconsistent or overlapping terms in the IAB Terms or other parts of an IO; however, if an IO expressly states that certain terms set forth in the IO are intended to supersede the terms of this Discord Addendum, then, in the event of conflict, those terms of the applicable IO will control only for that IO and only to the extent of such conflict. Any purchase order terms, “clickthrough” or other online agreements, or other similar documents made available to Media Company by Advertiser or Agency are hereby rejected by Media Company and will not apply to any Quest. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings given to such terms in the IAB Terms. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Where Advertiser is purchasing directly from Media Company, (i) <span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Section 2 and </span>any references to Agency herein will be deemed deleted and will not apply; and (ii) all references in the IAB Terms to Agency, will be deemed to be references to Advertiser.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Quest Terms.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">a. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quests</span>. Media Company will implement a promotional campaign on its platform (the “<strong>Discord Platform</strong>”) for Advertiser’s applicable property designated on an IO (the “<strong>Advertiser Property</strong>”) where eligible users of the Discord Platform will be able to complete certain agreed-upon tasks relating to the Advertiser Property and earn certain agreed-upon rewards (“<strong>Rewards</strong>”), as further detailed in an applicable IO (each such campaign, a “<strong>Quest</strong>”).  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">b. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quest T&amp;Cs</span>. Media Company will, in consultation with Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, establish the specific terms and requirements for users governing each Quest (“<strong>Quest T&amp;Cs</strong>”), and will publish the Quest T&amp;Cs to users in connection with such Quest. The Quest T&amp;Cs will address, at a minimum (i) user eligibility requirements and any criteria and tasks that must be satisfied by a user in order to receive a Reward; (ii) the nature of the applicable Reward, including whether the Reward will be supplied by Media Company (each, a “<strong>Media Company Reward</strong>”) or Advertiser (each, an “<strong>Advertiser Reward</strong>”); and (iv) any other terms, conditions and limitations pertaining to the redemption and use of the Reward.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">c. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Advertiser Rewards</span>. Unless otherwise indicated on an IO, the Reward will be an Advertiser Reward approved by Media Company and either the Advertiser or Agency, as applicable. For any Quest with an Advertiser Reward: (i) reasonably in advance of the applicable flight dates for a Quest, the parties will agree in writing (email to suffice) on and implement the fulfillment and redemption mechanics for the Advertiser Reward, which may consist of the delivery to Media Company of a sufficient number of redemption codes for users to redeem for Advertiser Rewards; (ii) Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will ensure that the Advertiser Reward and the redemption process is consistent with the Quest T&amp;Cs; and (iii) in the event of any fulfillment or redemption issues (including, without limitation, insufficient or defective redemption codes) in connection with a Quest, Media Company may suspend such Quest until such issues are resolved.  For clarity, Advertiser is solely responsible for the Advertiser Rewards and any associated fraud, losses, or other issues in connection with such Advertiser Rewards. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">d. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Media Company Rewards</span>.  For any Quest where the applicable IO indicates there will be a Media Company Reward, Media Company will (i) ensure that such Media Company Reward and redemption process is consistent with the Quest T&amp;Cs; and (ii) will have responsibility (unless otherwise agreed in the IO) and control over the design and creation of such Media Company Reward. Media Company will obtain Advertiser’s or Agency’s approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) for any Media Company Reward that contains or is derived from Advertising Materials. Media Company Rewards may not be available to users in certain regions where not supported by the Discord Platform. Advertiser and Agency may not terminate for convenience any Quest with (i) a Media Company Reward that contains or is derived from Advertising Materials or (ii) any other custom Media Company Reward created specifically for the Quest. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">e. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Advertiser Marks License</span>. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">i. Advertiser and Agency hereby grant Media Company a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use and display Advertiser’s name, designated trademarks and associated logos, and any names, trademarks or logos associated with the Advertiser Property (the “<strong>Advertiser Marks</strong>”) in connection with the implementation of a Quest, the performance of Media Company’s obligations under the Campaign Terms and any IO, or as otherwise approved in writing by Advertiser or Agency. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">ii. All goodwill and improved reputation generated by Media Company’s use of the Advertiser Marks inures to the exclusive benefit of Advertiser. Media Company will use the Advertiser Marks in a manner consistent with any branding guidelines provided by Advertiser to Media Company in writing.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">f. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Advertising Materials</span>.  Advertiser and Agency hereby grant Media Company a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, adapt, translate, modify, copy, publicly perform, transmit and distribute the Advertising Materials in connection with the implementation or promotion of a Quest, the performance of Media Company’s obligations under the Campaign Terms or as otherwise approved by Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, including, without limitation, in connection with the development, distribution and making available of applicable Media Company Rewards containing or derived from such Advertising Materials. The licenses set forth herein are sublicensable by Media Company to its affiliates, agents, and subcontractors in connection with Media Company performance hereunder (and, with respect to Media Company Rewards containing or derived from Advertising Materials, to end users who claim any such Media Company Rewards in connection with a Quest). Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will, at its own cost and expense, obtain all necessary licenses, consents, approvals and permissions from any third party required for Media Company to exercise its rights under the foregoing license. For purposes of the Campaign Terms, “<strong>Advertising Materials</strong>” means any content, materials, copy, branding, images, names, audio, music, video, artwork, designs, descriptions, specifications, and other elements made available by Advertiser or Agency to Media Company for use in connection with a Quest, including, without limitation, any elements, materials, assets or intellectual property from the Advertiser Property. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">g. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Cooperation</span>.  Media Company’s ability to implement the Quest and its obligations under the Campaign Terms and any IO (including, without limitation, the ability to meet the applicable timeframes and schedules for a Quest as specified in an IO) will be contingent upon the timely provision of cooperation from Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, in connection with the Quest, which cooperation includes, without limitation, providing any redemption codes, Advertising Materials and/or Advertiser Rewards as required by Media Company with sufficient lead time for the applicable Quest, compliance with applicable Policies or other campaign and asset specifications, and timely feedback, reviews and approvals for any items and matters requiring approval or input in connection with a Quest. Advertiser and Agency will adhere to any Policies and other agreed upon timeframes, campaign specifications, and development schedules in connection with the foregoing. Media Company will not be liable or responsible for any delays or issues caused by Advertiser’s or Agency’s failure or delay in providing such cooperation.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">h. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Quest Prompts</span>.  Media Company will be responsible for developing, producing, and displaying prompts or notifications promoting the availability of a Quest (“<strong>Quest Prompts</strong>”) to certain users on applicable surfaces within the Discord Platform. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Media Company will have ultimate authority and control over the content, placement, frequency, delivery, timing and accompanying disclosures in connection with all Quest Prompts on the Discord Platform. Media Company reserves the right to suspend or cancel the targeting, personalization, and/or delivery of Quest Prompts in connection with any Quest.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">i. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Reporting</span>.  For each Quest, Media Company will provide summary reports to Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, regarding certain estimated performance metrics, insights and KPIs within a reasonable timeframe after the midpoint and end date of such Quest. The information in such reports may be used by Advertiser solely for its own internal business purposes but will otherwise be considered Media Company’s Confidential Information. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">j. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Estimates</span>.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any impression or reach numbers, impression-related commitments, targeting parameters, geographies or estimates provided on an IO and any information provided in connection with any report delivered by Media Company with respect to any Quest are provided by Media Company solely on an “AS IS” basis as estimates for informational purposes based on the data reasonably available to Media Company and are not guaranteed or considered binding by the parties in connection with any Quest. Media Company will not be liable (or required to offer any makegood) for any errors, shortfalls, inaccuracies or omissions in connection with any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Agency Authority.</strong>  Agency represents, warrants and covenants that it has obtained and will maintain all consents, approvals and authorizations from Advertiser necessary for Agency to (i) bind Advertiser to the Campaign Terms and any IO, act on behalf of Advertiser and otherwise comply with its obligations in connection with the Campaign Terms and any IO, including, without limitation, with respect to (a) the execution of any IOs on Advertiser’s behalf, (b) the ability to pay Media Company for any Quest; (c) the ability to share Advertiser’s Confidential Information with Media Company; and (c) the management and provision of any and all approvals, feedback and reviews in connection with the Campaign Terms and any IO (e.g., the review and approval of Rewards and other Quest elements, press releases, promotional materials, or creative assets); and (ii) grant the licenses set forth in the Campaign Terms and any IO, including, without limitation, any such licenses to Advertiser Marks and Advertising Materials set forth herein. Media Company will be entitled to rely on any documents executed, instructions provided or approvals granted by Agency on an Advertiser’s behalf in connection with the Campaign Terms and any IO. Agency will indemnify and hold Media Company harmless from and against any losses or unpaid obligations under any IOs arising from Agency’s violation of this Section. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Taxes</strong>. Unless otherwise stated in an IO, Media Company’s fees do not include any direct or indirect local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including value-added, use, sales or withholding taxes collected by any jurisdiction. Each party is responsible for all of its own business taxes (including, but not limited to, net income, gross receipts, franchise, or other similar business taxes) arising as a result of or in connection with any IO. Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, is responsible for self-assessing any transaction taxes (e.g. sales tax, VAT, GST or similar taxes) due with respect to any IO. Media Company will collect, and Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will pay any applicable transaction taxes if Media Company determines that it has a duty to collect such taxes. Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, is responsible for any transaction taxes on user rewards redeemed outside of the Discord Platform. For transaction tax purposes, Quests will be treated as services related to promotional advertising campaigns. To the extent withholding tax is required by applicable law, Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will be responsible for collecting and remitting such taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Additionally, Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will provide Media Company an original receipt or documentation from the tax authority for the withholding tax payments.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Amendments to IAB Terms. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">a. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">General Acknowledgements</span>.  The parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) Quests are treated as flat-fee based Deliverables delivered on the Discord Platform for purposes of the IAB Terms; (ii) the terms of the IAB Terms relating to inventory availability, delivery schedule, ad placement and positioning, use of collected data, and reporting will be superseded and governed by the applicable terms of Section 1 of this Discord Addendum and any IO; and (iii) Quests do not use or involve any Third Party Ad Server and any associated terms in the IAB Terms do not apply.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent2\">b. <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Specific Amendments</span>. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">i. Section X(b) of the IAB Terms is hereby amended to add the following new subclauses (iv) and (v):</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify wysiwyg-indent4\"><em>“(iv) allegations that the Advertising Materials or Advertiser Marks infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights of a third party; or (v) Advertiser Rewards, including, without limitation, any claims from users that Advertiser Rewards were misleading or inaccurate or that they were not properly fulfilled.</em>”</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">ii. Section XI of the IAB Terms is hereby amended and restated as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify wysiwyg-indent4\">“<em>Excluding Agency’s, Advertiser’s, and Media Company’s respective indemnification obligations under the Campaign Terms, damages that result from a breach of Section XII, or intentional misconduct by Agency, Advertiser, or Media Company, in no event will any party be liable (i) for any consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or exemplary damages whatsoever or any damages for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of information, and the like, incurred by another party arising out of an IO, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages; or (ii) in the aggregate in connection with these Campaign Terms or the IO in excess of the amount paid or payable by Agency or Advertiser to Media Company hereunder.</em>”</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">iii. For purposes of Section XIV(d) of the IAB Terms, the choice of law governing any IO will be the State of New York without reference to its choice of law rules, and all claims, legal proceedings or litigations arising in connection with the Campaign Terms will be brought solely in state and federal courts located in New York City.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">iv. Section XIV.e of the IAB Terms is hereby amended and restated as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">“<em>All notices of termination or breach must be in English, in writing and addressed to the other party’s legal department (with a copy to any contact listed on an IO). The email address for notices being sent to the Media Company legal department is legal.notices@discordapp.com. All other notices must be in English, in writing (including email) and addressed to the other party’s applicable notice information designated on an IO. Notice will be treated as given on receipt, as verified by written or automated receipt or by electronic log (as applicable).</em>”</p>"

This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

HD streaming capability may be limited if people watching your stream have low bandwidth or are tuning in from an unsupported device. To ensure that everyone in the call can benefit from the HD Splash Potion, make sure everyone in the call has a strong internet connection and is watching from a desktop device.</p>"

Can I also take part in this promotion? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you previously had a Discord Nitro membership at any point on your accounts and have had a Nitro Classic or Nitro Basic membership in the past 12 months, you are ineligible to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p>If you have had a Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting membership active on your account and you’ve never had a Nitro membership,  you will be able to redeem this promotion and replace it with the 3 months Nitro membership.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">HOWEVER, please note: By choosing to activate this 3 month trial, you will lose any features associated with your current memberships, and <strong>you will not receive a refund for any remaining value on your current membership</strong>.</div>\n<p>At the end of the promotion period, you'll be converted to a paying Nitro membership per month unless you cancel your membership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JA8Q445NGJSRERZP9EEN9RJ1\">Payment Info and Membership Questions</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a membership plan, at the end of your 3 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p>\n<p>However, you can cancel the Nitro membership at any time before the end of the 3 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JA8Q445N15CEYT0QYEMR65FN\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro membership so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 3 months perk.</p>\n<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a \"This gift has been claimed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if you are given an invalid promo and we will not be able to provide a new promo.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error when I click on “Next”.</strong></p>\n<p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are ineligible for this promotion</li>\n<li>The promotion is invalid</li>\n<li>The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>\n<li>The link is invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem. See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p>\n<p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified. Make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift.”</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like your email isn’t verified, make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift” error, you are trying to redeem this Nitro promotion on a Discord account with an email that hasn’t been verified yet.</p>\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/213219267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this support article</a> on how to resend the email verification for your Discord account.

This is similar to how purchases work with the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360055386693\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Play Store</a>. Here's what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Discord account used for the first-time purchase of a subscription will link to the Apple ID used for the purchase.</li>\n<li>Future iOS subscriptions will automatically apply to that same Discord account.</li>\n<li>You cannot purchase or manage multiple subscriptions for two different Discord accounts through iOS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to purchase a Discord subscription on iOS for a different account than the one linked to your Apple account, there are a few options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try using a different device or Discord platform, such as the desktop app, to purchase the subscription on the secondary Discord account. </li>\n<li>If you're not using your original Discord account, you can cancel the subscription tied to it and delete the account. Once both steps are complete, you will be able to use your Apple ID on the new account. <strong>Please note:</strong> the account deletion process will take up to 15 days to complete. '</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"warn-box\">\n<strong>Note</strong>: Discord is unable to assist with Apple subscription issues.

What should I do?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #37352f;\">A: If you purchased a subscription directly from the Apple App Store via your Apple device, the purchase should appear under the Discord account associated with your Apple ID.

Then, your Nitro Credits will activate automatically, lasting for the time you've earned. Once your Nitro Credits have been fully used, your paid Nitro subscription will automatically renew again.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I’m a current Nitro subscriber. What happens to my billing date if I earn Nitro credits?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your billing date will be adjusted to reflect any additional time earned through Nitro Credits. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: I have active Server Boosts with my current Nitro subscription. What happens to these Boosts if I activate my Nitro Credits?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your existing Server Boosts will remain active and unchanged. While Nitro Credits are active, you’ll be able to transfer your Boosts between servers as long as it follows the normal cooldown periods. See our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boost FAQ</a> for more information.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I purchase new Server Boosts when Nitro Credits are active?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you won’t be able to purchase new Server Boosts when Nitro credits are active. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I cancel any Server Boost subscriptions I have while Nitro Credits are active?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you won’t be able to cancel any pre-existing Boost subscriptions until your Nitro Credits have been completely used. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I earn Nitro Credits when my subscription is past due?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're rewarded Nitro Credits while your subscription is past due, they will be applied in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If no successful payment is made during the 30-day grace period, the credits will be applied after the grace period ends.</li>\n<li>If a payment is successful, the credits will be applied at your next billing cycle. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use my earned Nitro Credits at any time?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nitro Credits activate between billing cycles. They will automatically apply once your current subscription period ends. If you don’t have an active Nitro subscription, your Nitro Credits will be activated immediately upon earning them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do Nitro Credits interact with Subscription Credits (Gifts)?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The interaction between Nitro Credits and Subscription Credits depends on your specific situation. Here are some common scenarios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Active gift credit, no stored credits:</strong> Nitro Credits activate after current gift period ends.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Multiple stored gift credits with an active subscription:</strong> Nitro Credits activate after the current billing period. Then, the next gift credit will be used to continue the subscription.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stored gift credits, no active subscription:</strong> Nitro Credits activate immediately. Doesn't affect existing gift credits.</li>\n</ol>"
