Any purchase order terms, “clickthrough” or other online agreements, or other similar documents made available to Media Company by Advertiser or Agency are hereby rejected by Media Company and will not apply to any Quest.

Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, is responsible for self-assessing any transaction taxes (e.g. sales tax, VAT, GST or similar taxes) due with respect to any IO. Media Company will collect, and Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will pay any applicable transaction taxes if Media Company determines that it has a duty to collect such taxes. Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, is responsible for any transaction taxes on user rewards redeemed outside of the Discord Platform. For transaction tax purposes, Quests will be treated as services related to promotional advertising campaigns. To the extent withholding tax is required by applicable law, Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will be responsible for collecting and remitting such taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Additionally, Advertiser or Agency, as applicable, will provide Media Company an original receipt or documentation from the tax authority for the withholding tax payments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #2e3338;\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">4.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

Or you can give the promotion link to a friend who hasn't had Nitro before.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month perk.</p>\n<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a \"This gift has been redeemed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo link has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've redeemed this promo link on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>In particular, if you redeem this promo link using your mobile device, double check the browser on your mobile device and see which Discord account you are currently logged into.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo link has been redeemed, the promo link cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the link is invalid. If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link sent to your email.</p>\n<p>If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their email.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p>\n<p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified. Make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift.”</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like your email isn’t verified, make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift” error, you are trying to redeem this Nitro promotion on a Discord account with an email that hasn’t been verified yet.</p>\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/213219267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this support article</a> on how to resend the email verification for your Discord account.

For Discord users and businesses, this means they may be eligible to have certain taxes not charged to their Discord purchases. These exemptions vary by state, country and jurisdiction.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JM35B0EPY92AXCQHKW\">Required Documentation</h1>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Info</strong>: It is your responsibility to submit all required information for a tax exemption before making any qualifying purchases. Submitting a tax exemption request does not guarantee you will receive this exemption. Discord will review your documents and relevant tax authority records to determine whether an exemption should be applied.</span></div>\n<p>To help you submit the correct documentation for your tax exemption request, review the section below that applies to your situation:</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMXSP2XZH7PWK0QZGJ\">VAT Exemptions </h2>\n<p>If you're requesting a VAT exemption, you'll need to provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your valid VAT ID number - this must be active and verifiable</li>\n<li>Your country of registration</li>\n<li>Complete invoice details including your registered business name and address</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMV9S7DK4SBGDZ3YEE\">US Tax Exemptions</h2>\n<p>For organizations based in the United States, please provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your sales tax exemption certificate with all required fields completed. Forms will vary by state, so please be sure to provide us with the form applicable to your state.</li>\n<li>Your state code - this is required for proper processing</li>\n<li>Complete invoice information matching your tax-exempt organization</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JM4EXTVEVRM47HJEQZ\">Other Tax Exemptions</h2>\n<p>For all other types of tax exemptions, you'll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A valid Tax ID number from your local tax authority</li>\n<li>Your country of registration</li>\n<li>Complete invoice details that match your registration</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Info</span></strong><span style=\"color: #434343;\">: We verify the documentation for accuracy and validity. If necessary, we may contact the issuing state’s or country’s tax authority to confirm legitimacy.</span>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JM4WKV0209PE0V34XC\">How to Validate Tax Exemption</h1>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Info</strong>: Tax exemptions apply only from the date of approval onward—previous purchases cannot be adjusted. Once validated, the exemption automatically applies to all future purchases.</span></div>\n<p>To help you get your tax exemption approved quickly, here's what we look for when reviewing your request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Valid ID Check</strong>: We'll verify your VAT/Tax ID with the official tax authorities to ensure it's current and valid.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Regional Verification</strong>: Your tax exemption must be applicable in your specific country or region.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Matching Addresses</strong>: For your security, your payment method's billing address needs to match the country where your tax exemption is registered.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation Review</strong>: We'll check that all your invoice details align with our verification records.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Final Review</strong>: Our Support team will carefully review your application to ensure everything is in order.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"info-box\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\"><strong>Info</strong>: Having all these items ready before submission can help speed up the approval process.</span></div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JTNWS5JMFBKRE9FEAY18FW8E\">What Happens After Submission?</h1>\n<p>Once you submit your tax exemption request, our dedicated Support team will carefully review your application.

Previous purchases cannot be adjusted retroactively.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if my tax ID or status changes?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You must notify our Support team immediately of any changes to your tax status or ID. This may require submitting a new application with updated documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use my tax exemption for multiple Discord accounts?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Each tax exemption is tied to a specific account and billing address. Separate applications are required for different accounts or organizations.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I need to update my business information?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Contact our support team with any changes to your business details. Some updates may require new documentation or re-verification of your tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I know if my organization qualifies for tax exemption?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Qualification depends on your organization's legal status and local tax regulations. We recommend consulting with your tax advisor or reviewing your local tax authority guidelines.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I get a tax exemption for purchases I made through Apple and/or Google Play?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>We cannot assist with tax exemption requests for purchases made through Apple or Google Play.</p>"

However, once you've claimed the trial on desktop, you'll be able to enjoy all Nitro features across both desktop and mobile devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I don't see the trial offer or did not receive it. Why?</strong></p>\n<p>A: This trial is subject to eligibility restrictions. If you do not see the trial on your account, this indicates that you are not eligible at this time. Please note that the Discord support team is not able to bypass eligibility restrictions.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I purchase a subscription during my free trial?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your paid subscription will begin immediately, replacing your trial. Any remaining trial days will be forfeited. For instance, if you purchase a subscription on day three of your trial, you'll immediately switch to the paid subscription instead of using your remaining four trial days.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I complete a Quest and earn Nitro during my one-week trial? </strong><br>If you earn a one-day Nitro reward from completing a Quest while your one-week trial is active, the one-day reward will replace your remaining trial time. This means your trial will end, and you'll receive only the one-day of Nitro instead of your remaining trial days.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is this free Nitro trial I received?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Discord is currently offering a special Nitro trial to selected users. This trial grants you access to Nitro features without requiring a payment method upfront. Users who upgrade to a paid subscription at the end of their trial will receive a bonus one-week trial upon upgrading.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is this free Nitro trial legitimate?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes! This is an official Discord trial offer that is being granted to a limited number of eligible users.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How long does the trial last?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You can enjoy your Nitro perks for the duration of your trial period.

If you sign up for the bonus one-week trial, your trial will convert to a paid subscription at the end of this additional week, unless cancelled before the end of the trial. You can manage your subscription settings at any time during the bonus trial through your <strong>User Settings &gt; Nitro</strong>.

Different servers can use the same tag, though the combination of the tag and icon will help distinguish your community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens to members' profiles if our server loses the Server Tag perk?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If your server loses the Server Tag perk due to insufficient boosts, the tag will no longer be available for members to wear on their profile. Any members who had the tag applied will have it automatically removed from their profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I change our Server Tag after it's been created?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, server owners and admins can change the Server Tag at any time. However, when you update a Server Tag, members will need to manually reapply the new tag to their profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can server members customize the color of the Server Tag on their profile?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, the color of the Server Tag is set by the server owner/admin and remains consistent for all members who use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How many Server Tags can a user display on their profile at once?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Users can display only one Server Tag on their profile at a time, even if they belong to multiple servers with tags.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I restrict which members can use our Server Tag?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Currently, there's no way to restrict which members can use the Server Tag. Any member of your server can choose to display it on their profile.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do Server Tags appear in messages or just on profiles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Server Tags that are applied to a user’s profile will appear next to their name everywhere on Discord. This includes in chat, member lists, and Direct Messages lists.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I include emoji or special characters in a Server Tag?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Server Tags can consist of alphanumerical characters and certain special characters. Certain characters, spaces, and emojis are not supported at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can my server have multiple Server Tags?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, each server can only have one Server Tag at a time. If you want to change your server's tag, you'll need to update the existing one rather than creating additional tags. Remember that when you update your Server Tag, members will need to reapply the new tag to their profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will other users be able to click on my Server Tag to join the server?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, selecting a Server Tag will open the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/30715364399511-Server-Profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Server Profile</a> for that server. If applications are enabled, they can apply to join the server from the server profile. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use current Server Boosts on my server for Server Tags?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are a server admin or owner and you have 3 Server Boosts already available for your server to use, then you can enable Server Tags right away. If you don't have enough Server Boosts available, you may need to change your current Server Level or get more Boosts from your community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I edit or change my current Server Tag in my server? </strong></p>\n<p>A: If you update the Server Tag for your server, server members will have to reapply the tag again for the change to take effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Is there a rate limit for how many times I can change my server tag once it is set?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, there is a rate limit for changing your server tag. You can change your server tag after a certain period of time.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Once you've unlocked Enhanced Role Styles by applying 3 Server Boosts, you can apply gradient or holographic styles to as many roles as you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do Enhanced Role Styles appear on mobile devices?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Enhanced Role Styles are fully supported on all Discord platforms, including mobile. Members will see gradient and holographic roles on iOS and Android just as they appear on desktop/browser.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I combine Enhanced Role Styles with other role features like role icons?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Absolutely! Enhanced Role Styles work alongside all other role features, including role icons, so you can create truly distinctive roles for your community.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If I switch from gradient to holographic (or vice versa), will I need to spend additional boosts?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. Once Enhanced Role Styles are unlocked for your server, you can freely switch between gradient and holographic styles for any role without using additional boosts.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do members need to have a specific Discord version to see Enhanced Role Styles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Members will need a reasonably current version of Discord to see Enhanced Role Styles. Anyone using an outdated app version may only see the solid color version of the roles.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do Enhanced Role Styles appear in dark mode vs. light mode?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Enhanced Role Styles are designed to look great in both dark and light mode, with automatic adjustments to ensure visibility and aesthetic appeal in either theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I disable the animation effect for Enhanced Role Styles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Select the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31809886435863\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">] next to your Discord username to access your <strong>User Settings</strong>, select the <strong>Accessibility</strong> tab, and then enable <strong>Enabled Reduced Motion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I add Enhanced Role Styles to a server I'm a member of?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you're a server member who wants to enable Enhanced Role Styles for your server, you can Boost your server to ensure there are enough Boosts available for a perk like this. However, only server admins &amp; owners can enable this perk and configure it for their server.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31809877381271\" width=\"575\" height=\"444\"></strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JT6WD7SHK6QQG5FN079A52WB\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">Enable Reduced Motion setting</h4>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I use the current Server Boosts on my server for Server Tags instead?</strong></p>\n<p>A: As a server owner or admin, you can disable the currently applied boosts to a level. To do so, head to the <strong>Server Boosts</strong> tab and then press on <strong>Disable Perk</strong>. You’ll then receive a confirmation window press on <strong>Disable</strong> to confirm. You can use all available Server Boosts to unlock <a href=\"#h_01JT6W75AN5YEZQ9RPSENYX9VH\">Additional Perks</a>.</p>"

For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need to verify my age to access content flagged by our Sensitive Media Filter and settings?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, age verification is required before you can access that flagged content and the sensitive media filter settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need to verify my age multiple times to change the settings for the Sensitive Media Filter?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. Age verification is a one-time process. Once your age group is confirmed, you won't need to verify again when you attempt to access an age-restricted feature. However, if you believe your age group is incorrect, you may retry the age verification process again.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if my age group is verified incorrectly or it fails to verify.</strong></p>\n<p>A: You have two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Retry verification through your chat with Discord system messages where you can select <strong>Retry </strong>to enter the verification flow again.</li>\n<li>You can retry by opting for a <strong>manual review </strong><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a><strong>. </strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Q: How long does verification take?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The verification process typically takes just a few minutes.

What should I do?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The streak calculation differs between products: Nitro subscription streaks are based on the subscription date, while Server Boost streaks start from when you begin boosting a server. Since purchases use <strong>Universal Time</strong> (<strong>UTC</strong>), the displayed date may differ by up to <strong>24 hours </strong>from your local time.</p>"

Otherwise, it’s possible that you may be hitting a temporary server error due to excessive load on the Bluesky network and you’ll have to try connecting your Bluesky account again later.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JHKE0REB3N61580PK2TPTFR6\">Using a Custom Domain with Bluesky</h1>\n<p>In order to link a Bluesky account with a custom-domain handle, Discord will need to look up your account’s DID. This happens when you initially connect the Bluesky account on Discord and then on an ongoing basis to keep your account connected to Discord. </p>\n<p>Verification happens in the same way described in the <a href=\"https://atproto.com/specs/handle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AT Protocol documentation</a> and the <a href=\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bluesky blog</a>.</p>\n<p>When verifying a domain using the /.well-known/atproto-did method, Discord will use a user-agent string in the form of <code>Discord/1.0 (Discord API; +https://discordapp.com</code>. </p>\n<p>Please ensure that your web server does not block requests with this user-agent, or severely rate-limit requests to this endpoint.</p>\n<p>You can simulate the request Discord will make to verify your handle using a curl command in this form: <code>curl -H 'User-Agent: Discord/1.0 (Discord API; +https://discordapp.com)' https://{your-handle-here}/.well-known/atproto-did</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JHKE0REBV2TX0B2MVYBSHM1K\">Custom PDS Providers</h2>\n<p>Discord supports linking AT Protocol accounts hosted by third-party PDS providers in the same way as accounts hosted by Bluesky. If hosting your own PDS, please ensure that your web server allows Discord’s user-agent on the authentication and PDS data endpoints, in addition to the <code>/.well-known/atproto-did</code> endpoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JHKE0REB44CG7RMBX0M8W4HZ\">did:web: accounts</h2>\n<p>Discord also supports linking AT Protocol accounts that use <code>did:web: identifiers</code>. The requirements for the <code>/.well-known/atproto-did endpoint also apply to the /.well-known/did.json</code> endpoint.</p>\n<div class=\"form-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>If you run into any issues with linking your Bluesky account to your Discord account, please reach out to our support team through here: <a href=\"http://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://dis.gd/contact</a>\n</div>"
