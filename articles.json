This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JCRXH6J4HYMEW3BX91W3EWCT\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

You can learn more about Nitro <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Please note</strong>: if you don’t see the trial on your mobile device, head over to the Nitro page on desktop to check for availability. </div>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Because Nitro is a membership, at the end of your 2-week trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro.</p>\n<p>However, you can <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic-#h_01GFV3PNMEJEF92W0XX69MEE2W\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cancel Nitro</a> at any time, including during trial. To cancel Nitro on desktop, head to your <strong>User Settings </strong>&gt; select <strong>Subscriptions</strong> &gt; press <strong>Cancel </strong>within the Nitro banner. These steps may appear slightly different on mobile.  </p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Please note</strong>: You will not be charged until the trial ends and the membership renews. We’ll send an email before the paid membership begins, and you’ll have the opportunity to cancel before you are charged by following the steps <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/19580873036695-How-to-Cancel-your-Nitro-Subscription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</div>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a trial?</strong></p>\n<p>A: There is no charge for this 2-week Nitro trial. However, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm that the submitted payment method is valid. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>After you redeem the trial offer, we reverse the temporary hold to return the funds, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"info-box\">\n<strong>Please note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>"

After using your free potion, additional HD Splash Potions can be purchased for $0.99 USD each.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do I need Nitro or server boosts to use an HD Splash Potion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope! The HD Splash Potion grants HD streaming quality in a designated channel for a set period of time—for you, your friends, and other server members who have access to that voice channel. No Nitro or server boosts required!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How long does the HD Splash Potion last?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Once used, the HD Splash Potion will grant 12 hours of HD streaming quality in the channel where it was activated. Anyone who joins the designated channel will enjoy HD streaming until the potion’s effect expires.</p>\n<p>You can still control your streaming quality at any time. For instance, if you notice your device’s performance struggling, you can adjust the streaming quality in the Share Your Screen pop out.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does everyone in the channel need to have or use a HD Splash Potion to enjoy HD streaming quality?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope!

Once someone uses their HD Splash potion in a channel, anyone can enjoy HD streaming quality in that designated channel, regardless of friendship status.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens when the 12 hours are up?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Once the time is up, HD streaming quality in the designated channel will return to its standard quality for anyone without an active Nitro subscription.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I move the HD Splash effect from my potion to a different channel after I’ve activated it in one channel?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Nope. The HD Splash potion will only grant its effect in the channel where it was used. Choose the voice channel carefully before activating the potion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s your refund policy for the HD Splash Potion?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Potions are non-refundable—we’re unable to refund potions after purchase or use.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if a person with low bandwidth is watching my HD Splash Potion stream?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The effect of the HD Splash Potion can be impacted by the technical limitations of your or your fellow streamers' device or bandwidth. HD streaming capability may be limited if people watching your stream have low bandwidth or are tuning in from an unsupported device. To ensure that everyone in the call can benefit from the HD Splash Potion, make sure everyone in the call has a strong internet connection and is watching from a desktop device.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JA8Q445N15CEYT0QYEMR65FN\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

This is similar to how purchases work with the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360055386693\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Play Store</a>. Here's what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Discord account used for the first-time purchase of a subscription will link to the Apple ID used for the purchase.</li>\n<li>Future iOS subscriptions will automatically apply to that same Discord account.</li>\n<li>You cannot purchase or manage multiple subscriptions for two different Discord accounts through iOS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to purchase a Discord subscription on iOS for a different account than the one linked to your Apple account, there are a few options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try using a different device or Discord platform, such as the desktop app, to purchase the subscription on the secondary Discord account. </li>\n<li>If you're not using your original Discord account, you can cancel the subscription tied to it and delete the account. Once both steps are complete, you will be able to use your Apple ID on the new account. <strong>Please note:</strong> the account deletion process will take up to 15 days to complete. '</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"warn-box\">\n<strong>Note</strong>: Discord is unable to assist with Apple subscription issues.

What should I do?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #37352f;\">A: If you purchased a subscription directly from the Apple App Store via your Apple device, the purchase should appear under the Discord account associated with your Apple ID.

If your server is Partnered or Verified, you will have the corresponding badge next to your server’s name.

When submitting your transfer request, please only select <strong>Yes</strong> under <strong>Is your server Partnered, Verified?</strong> if your server is confirmed to be Partnered or Verified, not Community. Choosing incorrectly could delay your request processing.</div>\n<p>After confirming that the server is part of our Partner or Verified program, only the server owner can submit an ownership transfer request.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7F84ST9CK89DKAHPK6AM7Y7\">What if I Want to Request an Ownership Transfer of Multiple Servers?</h1>\n<p>Our team can only handle one server per request.

The current server owner has 7 days to respond to our inquiry. If they approve the transfer or they don’t respond within 7 days, we transfer the server if eligible per our requirements. If the current owner denies the transfer request or the criteria for transfer is not met, we will not be able to proceed with the transfer of the server.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7F85Q2GC0CWCWTRMWYP5J38\">A Note on Data and Your Privacy</h1>\n<p>In line with data minimization principles, information provided by you in your server ownership transfer request will be deleted after the transfer is complete.</p>\n<p>We take your privacy and data security seriously. The information collected during the server ownership transfer process, including the server name, server ID, inactive owner's Discord username and user ID, and the new owner's Discord username and user ID, will be used solely for processing your transfer request. This data will be handled confidentially and in accordance with <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a> and applicable data protection laws.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history.

It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no!

This added layer of security for audio and video calls gives visual confirmation that no one else can listen in on your calls or watch your stream besides the intended participants/viewers.</p>\n<div class=\"mega-box\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> All audio and video conversations in direct messages (DMs), group messages (GDMs), voice channels, and Go Live streams on Discord will soon be end-to-end encrypted by default.</div>\n<p>Below explains how to verify that a call is end-to-end encrypted and how to confirm that the people who you are on a call with are verified too.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: Desktop and mobile calls between users with updated clients are end-to-end encrypted without any user action.</strong> The features described in this article do not “turn on” end-to-end encryption. We developed these features to show our work and help you confirm that our end-to-end encryption is functioning as intended.</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4F57TT88E7MHVTS47\">How to Verify That a Call is End-to-End Encrypted</h1>\n<p>You can verify that your voice call on Discord is end-to-end encrypted by checking the <strong>Voice/Video Details</strong> of the call.</p>\n<p>On the desktop app, open the <strong>Voice/Video Details</strong> in the bottom left corner of the app to see a new <strong>Privacy</strong> tab, as well as a <strong>green lock icon</strong> stating that your call is <strong>End-to-end encrypted</strong>. </p>\n<p>On the mobile app, you can find that <strong>green lock icon</strong> while in a voice call by pressing on the voice channel name in the top left corner of the focused voice call view.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336152838167\" width=\"279\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>Privacy</strong> tab contains the <strong>Voice Privacy Code</strong> for the call. Privacy codes can be compared with other voice call participants to confirm that everyone in the call sees the same code. Comparing codes should occur out-of-band, for example on a different communication platform.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>Privacy codes are long so we split them up into groups of five digits to make them easier to read.</div>\n<p>Privacy codes update when participants join or leave calls, so these codes must be compared at the same time with all current call participants in order to verify that the call is end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p>Each Go Live stream associated with a call also has a <strong>Stream Privacy Code </strong>that can be accessed via the context menu for the stream, which you can find by right-clicking directly on the Go Live stream and selecting it from the dropdown menu.</p>\n<p>By verifying the privacy code for the voice call or for any Go Live stream in the call, you can confirm that all participants have the same encrypted view of the call and that no unexpected participants have joined the call.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4RGNV5D9YRX2G30VM\">How to Verify Participants on a Call</h1>\n<p>Whether you’re on a call with your best friend, or a group of people in a voice channel on your favorite server, you can choose to verify the identity of the people you’re on a call with for an additional layer of privacy assurance. </p>\n<p>1. Navigate to “View Verification Code”. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>On Desktop, right click on the user in the voice call members list or right click on their tile in the call view and select <strong>View Verification Code</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>\n<li>On Mobile, open the user's profile either from the call member list or by long pressing on their call tile and then select <strong>View Verification Code</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2. You will then see a series of numbers that should match for both you and the person you’re on a call with. </p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>When you show the <strong>Verification Code</strong> for another participant, you may see a warning if you have previously verified that participant and the code has changed.</div>\n<p>3. Compare the codes out-of-band (via a different communication platform) with the person you’re speaking with.</p>\n<p>4. If the codes are a match, then you can select <strong>Mark as Verified</strong> to confirm that you have successfully verified who you are chatting with. </p>\n<p>Once you’ve verified each person in the call, a small icon will appear next to their name in the call to confirm this action is complete. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336147078423\" width=\"305\" height=\"356\"></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336147080471\" width=\"624\" height=\"256\"></p>\n<p>These codes are device-specific and change every time you join a new call with that person by default. With each new call, you will have to repeat the verification process. </p>\n<p>You can opt-in to persistent verification keys to make the verification others perform of your given device permanent. More information on how to do this in the next section.</p>\n<div class=\"tip-box\">\n<strong>Note: </strong>Verification Codes are long so we split them up into groups of five digits to make them easier to read.</div>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G47PAKXTQQTJ9QDZ40\">Persistent Verification Keys</h1>\n<p>To avoid repetitive verification each time you are on a call with the same person, you can enable persistent verification keys. If you have this setting enabled, people you’re speaking with will be able to remember your device and mark it as verified. </p>\n<p>To enable persistent verification keys: </p>\n<p>1. Navigate to <strong>User Settings, </strong>then select <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong>. </p>\n<p>2. Select the <strong>Encryption </strong>tab, and toggle the <strong>Enable persistent verification codes</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336152844055\" width=\"624\" height=\"113\"></p>\n<p>Considerations for setup: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>For you to save a persistent verification key for the person you’re speaking with, they’ll need to have the <strong>Enable persistent verification codes</strong> setting enabled as well.</li>\n<li>Persistent verification keys are tied to your device, not your user account. This means that if both you and a friend enable this setting, you’ll remain verified to each other every time you join a voice call from those devices.</li>\n<li>If you log out and back in again on your device, you will lose access to any previously used persistent verification key on that device and others who previously persistently verified your device will see that you are unverified. If you want to use persistent verification keys, you will need to enable the <strong>Enable persistent verification codes</strong> setting again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Someone you previously persistently verified may appear unverified when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They’re using a different device than the one you persistently verified</li>\n<li>They had to log in again on the device you persistently verified</li>\n<li>Their persistent verification key was removed from local device storage</li>\n<li>They are being impersonated by someone else</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4ED1HCVY5NX29CJ58\">Managing Verified Devices</h1>\n<p>If you have verified other users with persistent verification codes enabled, you can manage these verified devices in your <strong>User Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Navigate to <strong>User Settings, </strong>then select <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong>. </p>\n<p>2. Select the <strong>Encryption </strong>tab where you’ll see <strong>Verified Devices</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">a. On Desktop, select the <strong>Encryption</strong> tab.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent4\">b. On Mobile, select<strong> End-to-end Encryption</strong> under the <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> tab.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26336152847383\" width=\"521\" height=\"466\"></p>\n<p>Each user, along with their verified device(s), will be displayed. You can choose to remove the verification for a specific device, identified by the time it was verified, or remove all verifications for a specific user.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J7M034G4ZJCDD1Y31ZXN24HB\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I know if my call is end-to-end encrypted?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You can verify that your call is end-to-end encrypted by checking for the green <strong>End-to-end encrypted lock icon</strong> in the <strong>Voice/Video Details</strong> on the desktop app or by pressing on the voice channel name details in the top left corner of the focused call view on mobile.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will E2EE A/V roll out to Discord web and consoles?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Starting September 2024, all updated desktop and mobile Discord clients will support E2EE A/V. Web and consoles will receive E2EE A/V support in 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why is my call not end-to-end encrypted when I’m on an updated Discord app?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Your call may not be end-to-end encrypted because you may be on a call with someone who is not on an updated Discord app. In 2025, all DMs, GDMs, voice channels, and Go Live streams will require updated clients that support end-to-end encryption.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I opt out of E2EE A/V?</strong></p>\n<p>A: E2EE A/V is enabled by default and cannot be turned off. E2EE A/V currently won’t apply to calls where an unsupported client (i.e., web and consoles) is being used by at least one user. Stage channels also will not be end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will the preview of my Go Live stream now be private for users not yet in the call?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Stream previews – when you are able to see a snippet of an ongoing Go Live stream - are NOT end-to-end encrypted. This means that users not in a call with an ongoing stream may be able to see a preview of the stream. You can<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> disable stream previews</a> forever, or on a per-stream basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I verify the end-to-end encryption status in Go Live streams?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, each Go Live stream has a <strong>Stream Privacy Code</strong> that can be accessed via the context menu for the stream. You can compare this code out of band with other participants to verify that the stream is end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens if I change my device/log into my Discord account on a new device?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you change your device and have persistent verification codes enabled, you will need to go through the <a href=\"#h_01J7M034G47PAKXTQQTJ9QDZ40\">verification process</a> again as verification is tied to the specific device. Persistent verification keys must be re-enabled on a new device.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><br><br><br></p>"

Tap <strong>Let’s go</strong> to start the Passkey enrollment process. You’ll be prompted by your operating system, if supported, to enroll a Passkey.

After enrolling MFA, the Discord app will also have a list of backup codes for login: each of these can be used once instead of a code generated by your app, in case you lose access to it. Make sure to <strong>download and store these backup codes!</strong> If you lose these, Discord can’t help you get back into your account.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365139351\" width=\"609\" height=\"422\"></p>\n<p>And you’re done!</p>\n<p>You can now register another Security Key on this device or a different device (you can have up to 16 security keys/passkeys at the same time).</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J806DMWBQWMCM3XC01X2PX61\">Passwordless Login with Passkeys</h1>\n<p>Using your passkey to log in is simple! As long as you have a password manager available with a passkey saved in it, you will be prompted to select a passkey. If you’re not getting prompted, you can always tap on <strong>Or, sign in with Passkey</strong> instead. Your system will prompt you to select the Passkey associated with your account and complete a challenge (e.g., Face ID), then you’re logged in!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429353488151\" width=\"624\" height=\"333\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J806DMWB34KBHKM4XSWZ0FGM\">How to Use Security Keys</h1>\n<p>While Security Keys function similarly to passkeys, they generally cannot be used for one-step login on Discord. Fear not! You’ll still be able to use Security Keys as a form of MFA - when you log in, you’ll get an additional challenge after entering your username and password to use you security key:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365142807\" width=\"624\" height=\"363\"></p>\n<p>Press <strong>Authenticate with security key</strong> to interact with your Security Key, and you’re in!</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J806DMWBCY8EPFTCYAP1KEF7\">Passkey Troubleshooting</h1>\n<p>Having issues with your passkey when trying to log in? Here are some troubleshooting steps to try if your passkey isn’t working for any reason:</p>\n<p>First, try using your username and password to log in, then using your Passkey on the following MFA Challenge screen. If that doesn’t work, you’ll need to delete the existing Passkey from both your device and Discord account, then set it up once again. To do this:</p>\n<p>1. Make sure you have your Discord backup codes handy just in case. Open your password manager and remove the passkey from your saved credentials for Discord. Refer to your password manager’s documentation for details on how to do this.</p>\n<p>2. Use a different MFA method or device to complete the challenge. If you don’t have another set up, you can use a backup code from the list you saved to complete the MFA challenge and finish the login.</p>\n<p>3. Go to your Account Settings and repeat the enrollment process to register a new passkey with your password manager. See<a href=\"#h_01J806DMWB4STCJ8RCKAEF3EV8\"> How to Register Passkeys</a> above for more details, and be sure to remember what you name it!</p>\n<p>4. From the Account Settings screen, delete the old passkey associated with your Discord account.</p>\n<p>And now you’re starting fresh! Following these steps ensures your remaining saved backup codes continue to work while enrolling a new Passkey.</p>"

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J604ZZAFY2ZAWS7CNP2K04V8\"><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J604ZZAFES4XYS9NAKHT8QH8\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro membership so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 3 months perk.</p>\n<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"This gift has already been claimed\" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a \"This gift has been claimed already\" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p>\n<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if you are given an invalid promo and we will not be able to provide a new promo.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error when I click on “Next”.</strong></p>\n<p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are ineligible for this promotion</li>\n<li>The promotion is invalid</li>\n<li>The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>\n<li>The link is invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem. See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a \"Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption\" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>\n<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> this article</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p>\n<p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified. Make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift.”</strong></p>\n<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like your email isn’t verified, make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift” error, you are trying to redeem this Nitro promotion on a Discord account with an email that hasn’t been verified yet.</p>\n<p>You can check out <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/213219267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this support article</a> on how to resend the email verification for your Discord account.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J6YTTK2CWV2YEDAGDTTR6FGV\">\n<strong>NOTE: </strong>Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J6YTTK2CFA5B3C1EJVV5BME5\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

By selecting the \"Data Saver\" option, your videos will upload more quickly and consume less data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Saving Mode: </strong>If enabled, images and videos will be sent in lower quality through your cellular network to use less data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321162519\" width=\"430\" height=\"863\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J4M00QYZMNPF2W7MRC1QHWSZ\">What is NSFW Content Scanning?</h1>\n<p>\"NSFW\" or Not Safe For Work (or not suitable for work) is a term to describe inappropriate content that you wouldn't want to look at while in the workplace and is now more widely used to describe content that could be seen as inappropriate for the public.</p>\n<p>To help keep users safe, we have both a user and server setting to scan images for NSFW content.

If you have the <strong>With image descriptions </strong>setting enabled and if an image has ALT text, you should see the word <strong>ALT</strong> on the image.

If you need a visual aid, pressing <strong>ALT</strong> this will show the text.</p>\n<p>Congratulations! You now have the skills to upload images, send files, and perform other actions through Discord.</p>"
