The status of the charge will then change to <strong>failed</strong> in your <strong>User Settings &gt; Billing</strong>. If a pending charge still appears on your bank statement, it should be removed within <strong>5-10 business days</strong>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HX06JJ3THP9DD6JG7AVJTD9Z\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: I just paid for my past due membership? Why was I charged twice? </strong></p>\n<p>A: After you have paid for your past due membership, your next membership renewal may be charged immediately depending on the renewal date of your membership. You can find the date your membership renews under <strong>User Settings &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Payment</strong>. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I cancel or change my membership plan while it has a past due payment? </strong></p>\n<p>A: You can cancel your membership while it’s in a past due state by visiting <strong>User Settings &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Cancel</strong>. However, you won’t be able to change the plan you’re on until you pay for the past due payment on your current plan. Learn more about managing your subscription <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19580873036695\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I redeem my Nitro gift credits while my membership is past due?</strong></p>\n<p>A:  Gift credits cannot be used to pay for the past due membership. You can find out more about what happens to your membership when it’s past due <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/23082866222871#h_01HX06JJ3T7FGTGYNQCXNW7P9W\">here</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: If my payment is not made on time, what happens to my perks?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Depending on which platform you purchased the membership, you’ll have access to your membership perks for 28-30 days after your payment fails. If you do not make the payment before this window ends, your membership will automatically end.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Does my billing date change if I resolve my payment issues after my membership is past due?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, making a payment on a membership that’s past due does not change your renewal date.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why do I see multiple charges on my bank account?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The only time you should see multiple pending charges are when your payments have not been successfully processed. When renewing a subscription and your renewal payment does not successfully go through, we will attempt the purchase again to ensure that your subscription goes uninterrupted. Once a payment successfully goes through, all other pending payments are canceled.</p>"

If you’re a new Nitro member, you’ll be able to share Nitro trials with others after 5 days.<br>Additionally, you may not see it due to the eligibility criteria for Nitro members. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: What happens after I share all 3 of my trials? </strong></p>\n<p>A: As a Nitro member, you’ll get more trials to share in the future.

If you are in a server where you want an app removed but don't have permissions, please reach out to the server admin or leave the server.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where can I use Apps?</strong></p>\n<p>A: <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2580c40c-7fff-dbfd-6cde-4a9d79bdf6a2\">Apps that are added directly to a server can be used within that server if the server’s permissions are set up to allow members to use that app. Apps that are added directly to a user’s account can be used in any server that the user is in.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: How do I install an app to my account?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Some apps can be installed to your account directly, instead of a server. Some developers will be updating their apps to enable this functionality. If you see an app that has this feature enabled, feel free to add the app to your account! Please note that apps that are added to your account may not have all the same capabilities as apps added to a server. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-c39d8fa9-7fff-bec8-aff4-b6e0f6352beb\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Q: My server utilizes AutoMod. Will messages from application commands be affected or flagged by AutoMod?</strong></p>\n<p>A: AutoMod will not flag messages from apps that you’ve installed onto your server.</p>\n<p>AutoMod will only flag messages from apps that are installed directly onto a user’s account. Any actions taken by AutoMod will happen on the user who installed the application and first used it in a server. This means if an application creates a message with buttons, additional messages created from interacting with those buttons will also action against the user who used the command initially.</p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-e85834a2-7fff-0283-d839-1b1aa05d5e5b\"><strong>Q: What data can an app access about me or my server or DM, or the people in it?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Apps you’ve added to your account can access your information that you've authorized. These apps are not able to access information about your server or DMs. They also do not have permissions to take action in your server or DMs, other than responding to your interactions. Additionally, user installed apps are not able to get information about members of your servers or DMs that have not used the app. If a user does choose to interact with the app (e.g., through buttons and select menus), then the app can access their basic user information, like their username, user ID, avatar, and (if in a server) your server nickname, roles, and permissions. </p>\n<p>Apps added to servers can access data as generally described <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7933951485975-Visibility-of-Bot-Data-Access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn more about a specific app's data practices, please refer to the app’s developer or its privacy policy.</p>\n<p><br><br></p>"

Any time someone sends a message, Discord shows a little white dot next to the channel and server to let you know a new message has been sent.</p>\n<p>It can be information overload, and so naturally you take the only action you can and mute the server. Problem solved, right?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it becomes harder to pay attention to the 1 or 2 channels you really like on that specific server. You start missing out on moments because it’s muted. You have to try to remember to go back to that server and check those specific channels. But what if you forget? </p>\n<p>If this sounds familiar, we have good news! Discord is introducing a “middle ground” setting between “show me everything” and “show me nothing”. Let’s go over this setting a little bit more.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2NDX2BVBJT724Y9TC\">How to setup the new notification feature</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T25RJ9DM6RFVHDESSQ\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">This experiment is available on both the desktop and mobile app, however, the below modal will only pop-up in the desktop app.</span></h3>\n<p>If this experimental feature becomes available to you, Discord will help you get started by showing this modal the next time you launch Discord.</p>\n<p>Just follow the prompts and select which servers have the most important updates for you!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266097815\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\"></p>\n<p>It will also help explain what has changed and give you a chance to pick and choose some servers that you want to try this feature out on right away. </p>\n<p>We recommend trying it on servers that might overwhelm you, but have channels you’re interested in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2YFE1F7MYV75QA4HV\">Notification Settings</h2>\n<p>Let’s go over how this feature affects each type of notification setting and then how to set a Custom setting on both desktop and mobile.</p>\n<p><strong>All Messages</strong>: When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>All Messages</strong>, everything will behave exactly like before: The channel is highlighted in white, and both the channel and server show a little white dot next to them.</p>\n<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message in the channel.</p>\n<p><strong>@Mentions</strong> (a.k.a. Only Mentions): When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>@Mentions</strong>, the channel is not highlighted. Instead the channel stays the same color, and shows a light gray dot next to it. It gives you a hint of activity, but doesn’t try to compel you to check in on the channel. </p>\n<p>Most importantly the server does not show a white or gray dot at all! This allows you to check these channels on your own schedule, instead of being nagged to check them right away.</p>\n<p>If someone mentions you in this channel though, the channel will be highlighted in white, and both the server and channel will have a red badge so you know something important happened.</p>\n<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message that mentions you in the channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Nothing: </strong>When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to “Nothing”, the channel and server will behave the same way as @Mentions, however you will never receive a notification from this channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>\n<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>\n<p>2. Right-click on the channel and then navigate to <strong>Notifications</strong> and then tap on <strong>Custom.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266099479\" width=\"395\" height=\"407\"></strong></p>\n<p>If you select the <strong>Custom</strong> option, this allows you to change each behavior independently, such as how should Discord display that there are new messages and when should Discord notify you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile</strong></p>\n<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>\n<p>2. Long press on the channel you want to adjust the settings for then tap on <strong>Notification Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>3. Here you can customize your notification settings for this channel.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084281584535\" width=\"365\" height=\"614\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T29T3D3A3ZQP39WCE5\">\n<span style=\"color: #434343;\">To learn more about notifications, please check out our </span><a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Notifications Settings 101</span></a><span style=\"color: #434343;\"> article.</span>\n</h3>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T27Q8S6MSRZ5P53J2H\">When should I use this specific notification setting?</h1>\n<p>This setting is best for larger, busy servers and channels where you may prefer to check them on your own schedule. Instead of muting them, now you can pick and choose the channels you care about most, without being notified to visit the other channels. It’s like a better way of muting! This setting allows you to ignore everything by default while picking the specific channels you care about in a server.</p>\n<p>For example: Do you want to know when there’s a new update to a game you play or an update to an app you use? You can set that server to <strong>Mentions Only</strong>, and then  select the channel with release announcements to <strong>All Messages</strong>! Now you’ll get notified about that one channel, without getting overwhelmed by the rest of the server.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2EA493Y2Y4HFXZPNP\">How do I turn this feature off?</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HNNXQ6T2F8Y8CZKACQJT1YDF\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">The option to disable this feature is only on the desktop app.</span></h3>\n<p>If you do not want to use this feature, here is how to disable it.</p>\n<p>1. Tap on the cogwheel [<img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084281586071\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">] in the bottom left corner of the desktop app to open up your <strong>User Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>2. Then scroll down until you see <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p>\n<p>3. Now tap on the <strong>check mark</strong> next to <strong>New Unread Settings (experimental)</strong> to toggle it to an <strong>x</strong> to turn it off. Your notification settings will be fully restored to a backup created earlier.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21084266103575\" width=\"624\" height=\"437\"></strong></p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this feature, please reach out to our <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Support team</span></a>.</p>\n<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>"

      "body": "<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Discord is committed to cultivating belonging and striving for excellence by treating all workers with respect, ensuring safe working conditions, being environmentally responsible, and leading with integrity and good faith ethical practices. We expect our suppliers and their subsidiaries, affiliates, and subcontractors (“<strong>Suppliers</strong>”) to operate their businesses with social, ethical, and environmental responsibility and integrity.  This Supplier Code of Conduct describes the legal, environmental, and social obligations for our Suppliers. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6GS2NZDCQF422231EY\">1. Compliance</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">When providing goods and services to Discord, Suppliers are required to fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations. They must also meet the expectations outlined in this Supplier Code of Conduct, along with any contractual requirements and additional terms.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Suppliers are expected to maintain a system designed to enable its operations to conform to the standards in this Supplier Code of Conduct and also record, identify, mitigate, and remediate any gaps and operational risks.  Upon request from Discord, Suppliers will accurately disclose information regarding their labor, health and safety, environmental practices, business activities, structure, financial situation, and performance, in accordance with prevailing industry practices. Suppliers will also allow and enable Discord (and any third party representing Discord) to assess a Supplier’s compliance with this Supplier Code of Conduct by inspecting and reviewing the Supplier’s facilities, practices, policies, and relevant records without notice and interviewing personnel without disruption or monitoring. Suppliers will communicate clear and accurate information about their practices, policies, and expectations to their workers, next-tier supplier(s), and customers, and will train their employees on their requirements under this Supplier Code of Conduct.  Suppliers will promptly implement reasonable corrective action to remedy any material non-conformance identified by Discord. Though we might seek to work with Suppliers to improve conditions, we also may terminate our relationship with any Supplier that fails to meet any of these responsibilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6GW4ZCNT78380RDQDV\">2. Labor and Human Rights</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">At Discord, we firmly believe in treating all workers with respect and dignity. We hold our Suppliers to the same standard and expect them to prioritize the well-being of their workers. This includes ensuring that all workers, regardless of their employment type, are treated with human decency.  Our Suppliers must adhere to the following standards in their operations:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>No Forced Labor.  </strong> Suppliers will not use forced, bonded (including debt bondage), indentured, or involuntary prison labor, and will not engage in slavery or trafficking of any person.  No matter the situation, all work must be voluntary, and workers should be able terminate their employment at any time. Suppliers will not require workers to pay any recruitment or employment fees or expenses.  Suppliers will ensure that workers always have access to their identity, immigration, or work permit documents. This means Suppliers may not hold, destroy, conceal, or confiscate identity or immigration documents, such as  government-issued identification, passports, or work permits. Suppliers can only hold  documentation if required by law. Even so, workers should never be denied access to their documents.  Suppliers should make sure that each worker receives a written agreement describing the terms of employment, and if there is international relocation involved, the agreement must be given and signed prior to the relocation.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>No Child Labor</strong>.  Suppliers will not use child labor. “Child” means any person under age 15, under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is greatest. Workers under the age of 18 will not perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, including night shifts, overtime, or physically or psychologically demanding work. In the absence of local law, suppliers must pay student workers, interns, and apprentices at least the same wage rates as other entry-level workers performing equal or similar tasks.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Wages.  </strong>Suppliers will pay legally-mandated wages and benefits and comply with the law regarding wage deductions. Suppliers must also provide workers with the basis on which workers are paid via pay stub or similar documentation. Deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure is not permitted.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Working Hours</strong>. Except in emergency situations, Suppliers will set a maximum of 60 hours per week (including overtime) for any workers paid on an hourly basis.  Workers should be allowed at least one day off every seven days. All overtime hours must be voluntary.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Abuse, Discrimination, and Harassment</strong>. Suppliers will not discriminate in screening, hiring, or employment practices based on race, color, age, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnicity, national origin, caste, disability, genetic information, medical condition, pregnancy, religion, political affiliation, union membership, covered veteran status, or any other category protected by applicable law. Workers’ religious practices should be reasonably accommodated.  </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Fostering Diversity</strong>. Because diversity, equity, and inclusion is crucial to us, our Suppliers must also demonstrate a commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion in all aspects of the workplace. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Freedom of Association.</strong>  Suppliers will respect workers rights to associate freely, bargain collectively, and seek representation in accordance with local laws. Suppliers are expected to permit workers to openly communicate and share grievances with management without fear of reprisal, intimidation, discrimination, or harassment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6G5BJ8P74N9SPE1D72\">3. Health &amp; Safety</h1>\n<p>Suppliers must ensure that all operations happen in healthy and safe working conditions for its workers.  Suppliers will further ensure that the following requirements are met:</p>\n<p>Occupational Safety and Health. Suppliers will comply with all applicable safety and health laws and regulations.  Suppliers will identify, evaluate, and control worker exposure to safety and health hazards, such as chemical, biological, physical, and ergonomic stressors, and other elements of physically demanding work, through proper design, engineering controls, maintenance, safe work procedures, and ongoing health and safety guidance. Suppliers must also identify, evaluate, and control worker exposure to the hazards of physically demanding tasks, including manual material handling and heavy or repetitive lifting, prolonged standing, and highly repetitive or forceful assembly tasks. When these methods cannot adequately control risks, suppliers must provide workers with personal protective gear and education about the risks involved in the language of the worker or in a language the worker can understand.  Suppliers will implement procedures to prevent, manage, track, and report occupational injury and illness. </p>\n<p>Machine Safeguarding. Production and other machinery shall be evaluated for safety hazards. Physical guards,  interlocks, and barriers are to be provided and properly maintained where machinery  presents an injury hazard to workers.</p>\n<p>Emergency Preparedness. Suppliers will identify and plan for potential emergencies, and Suppliers will implement emergency plans and provide guidance to workers on emergency response procedures, including emergency reporting, worker notification and evacuation, drills, fire detection and suppression equipment, exit facilities, and recovery plans in accordance with local law.</p>\n<p>Sanitation, Food, and Housing. Suppliers will provide workers with ready access to clean toilet facilities, potable water, and sanitary food preparation, storage, and eating facilities. If Suppliers provide workers with housing, those facilities will be clean and safe, including but not limited to adequate personal space, entry and exit privileges, emergency egresses, heat and ventilation, adequate lighting, and hot water for bathing and showering.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HKX0MA6GQAFMR6E0FVZFX6NT\">4. Environmental</h1>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We expect that our Suppliers will strive to create regenerative processes to minimize adverse effects on the community, environment, and natural resources while safeguarding the health and safety of the public. This includes the following:</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Environmental Permits and Reporting.</strong> Suppliers will obtain and keep current all required environmental permits, approvals, and registrations and follow their operational and reporting requirements.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Resource Efficiency and Clean Energy</strong>. Suppliers will work to reduce consumption of resources, including raw materials, energy, and water. Suppliers will seek to minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and use cleaner sources of energy.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>Hazardous and Restricted Substances</strong>. Suppliers will manage chemicals and other materials that pose a hazard to the environment to ensure their safe handling, use, storage, and disposal.
