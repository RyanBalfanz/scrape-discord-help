This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J604ZZAFY2ZAWS7CNP2K04V8\"><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J604ZZAFES4XYS9NAKHT8QH8\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already\" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an \"Oh no!

      "body": "<p>We have paid attention to user feedback regarding the reliability of Discord’s Game Overlay, which has been known to occasionally cause problems during gameplay. Moreover, it is only supported in a limited number of games due to compatibility challenges inherent to the current implementation.</p>\n<p>As a result, on <strong>April 15, 2024</strong>, Discord started to roll-out a revamped Game Overlay designed to significantly enhance stability, reliability, and performance. The new Game Overlay will not interfere with your game, and is expected to be compatible with nearly all games. This is currently out to 100% of users on the Canary and PTB versions of the Discord app. There is no ETA at this time as to when this will be fully rolled out to all users on the Stable version of Discord.</p>\n<p>After this date, you will experience the following changes in Game Overlay behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Game Overlay is now enabled by default for all games.</li>\n<li>Game Overlay will work in windowed fullscreen mode and windowed borderless fullscreen mode, but will not work in true fullscreen mode.\n<ul>\n<li>True fullscreen mode on desktop means that other computer applications cannot be displayed over the application that’s in true fullscreen mode.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Game Overlay will be hidden when the game window is not in focus.</li>\n<li>Screensharing the game window will not capture the Game Overlay, but screensharing the full screen will still capture the Game Overlay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J42RQ6P0QAC4P99CCMDFF134\">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: What do I do if I always run my game in true fullscreen mode?</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>A: Most games support borderless fullscreen mode, so you can switch to this mode to continue getting Discord’s Game Overlay in game.</p>\n<p>If you need to run the game in true fullscreen mode for any reason, there’s also a global <strong>Enable legacy overlay</strong> option in <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Game Overlay</strong>. Please note that this option may be removed in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25289838883991\" width=\"668\" height=\"376\"><br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I keep using the legacy Game Overlay?</strong><br>A: You can continue using it as long as the option exists in the app, but our goal is to eventually move everyone over to the revamped Game Overlay so they can enjoy a more stable and performant experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if the game I play only works with the legacy Game Overlay?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Please first check that you are running borderless fullscreen mode, or sometimes called “windowed” fullscreen mode. The revamped Game Overlay should work in this mode.</p>\n<p>If you still experience issues with it, please reach out to our <a href=\"http://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Support team</a> for further assistance.</p>"

Nothing in the MSA authorizes Provider to act as agent for or conduct business in the name of Discord.

This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>\n<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1QBC9CK2WWF9ZVT6ASCV2PH\"><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>\n<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J1QBC9CKRZ9H04MT209T8Z71\">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>\n<p><strong>Q: I see a \"Oh no!

This filter can help you reduce exposure to offensive or unwanted language, giving you a more comfortable experience on Discord. It works by redacting detected keywords with asterisks (****) from a pre-selected library of words. </p>\n<p>The filter is opt-in, and allows you to turn it on and off whenever you’d like. This filter only runs on your Discord client locally, meaning, this automatic filtering does not happen on Discord servers and Discord does not read your messages to power this filter. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01J1QCP3DHMW0H5RBHW63GF6VP\">How to Enable/Disable the Language Filter</h1>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1QCP3DHCGKAW56ZM44FHH5W\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">This feature is available on desktop, browser, and mobile.</span></h3>\n<p>1.

The filter works directly on your device, so your messages stay private and are not sent to Discord’s servers for filtering.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What types of keywords are filtered?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The filter uses the same keyword list as<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/auto-moderation-in-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Automod</a>, which filters words from a preset list selected by Discord of commonly flagged words in the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Insults and Slurs</strong>: Personally insulting material, including terms that may be considered slurs or hate speech.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sensitive Content</strong>: Sexually explicit language.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severe Profanity</strong>: Egregious forms of profanity, while still allowing for mild forms of cursing or swearing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I add my own keywords to this list?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, the filter is not customizable.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I turn off or disable the language filter?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, the filter is opt-in and can be enabled or disabled in the <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> tab in your  <strong>User Settings </strong>at any time. This setting is disabled by default.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can I view the blocked word in the message without having to turn the filter off?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you will have to disable the filter to view blocked words.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will we support other languages besides English?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We’ll explore options for supporting other languages in future versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Where will the filter work?</strong></p>\n<p>A: The filter works in DMs, GDMs (group messages), or in servers where server moderators have not enabled<a href=\"https://discord.com/safety/auto-moderation-in-discord\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Automod</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Will the language filter apply to all devices I use Discord on?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, the filter setting will apply across all devices you use Discord on.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What should I do if I find a word that should be filtered, but isn’t?</strong></p>\n<p>A: There is no way to provide feedback on specific requests, but we’ll continue to evolve the keyword list overtime.</p>"
